The analysis of 3D tomograms revealed that the pNeh(9)-b-pNpm(9) thin films absorbed a large amount of water, resulting in the formation of membranes that were nearly flat and giant multicompartment vesicles dispersed in the water phase. A simple lamellar phase appeared when the films were dried. In contrast, pNeh(18)-b-pNpm(18) thin films absorbed little water and formed small highly curved unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles. Water was located mainly outside the closely-packed vesicles. When water was removed by drying, the walls of adjacent vesicles collapsed to form honeycomb-like capsules. The changes in domain size reflected changes in chain conformations. The pNpm(9) blocks were saturated by water and fully extended, while pNpm(18) blocks were neither saturated by water nor fully extended. In addition, the thicknesses of hydrophobic blocks in the hydrated films of both pNeh(9)-b-pNpm(9) and pNeh(18)-b-pNpm(18) were smaller than those in the dry films, reflecting an increase of the average distance between the neighboring junctions of polypeptoid molecules.¬µ [Jiang, Xi; Zuckermann, Ronald N.; Balsara, Nitash P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sun, Jing] Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Polymer Sci & Engn, Shandong Prov Educ Dept, Key Lab Biobased Polymer Mat, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zuckermann, Ronald N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA USA; [Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Qingdao University of Science & Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeleyn  Jiang, X; Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.&  xijiang@lbl.gov; nbalsara@berkeley.edu0  Zuckermann, Ronald/A-7606-2014; , XI/I-1439-2017@  Zuckermann, Ronald/0000-0002-3055-8860; , XI/0000-0002-9589-7513¬ê  Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program [KC11BN]¬ù  Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program¬∂  Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy, Grant/Award Number: DE-AC02-05CH11231; Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program, Grant/Award Number: KC11BN  WILEY  HOBOKEN(  111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	  0032-3888	  1548-2634  POLYM ENG SCI  Polym.

Traditionally, electron diffraction is used to study crystalline polymers while transmission electron microscopy is used to study microphase separation in stained block copolymers and other multiphase systems. We describe developments that eliminate the barrier between these two approaches-it is now possible to image polymer crystals with atomic resolution. The focus of this Review is on high-resolution imaging (30 angstrom and smaller) of unstained polymers. Recent advances in hardware allow for capturing numerous (as many as 10(5)) low-dose images from an unperturbed specimen; beam damage is a significant barrier to high-resolution electron microscopy of polymers. Machine-learning-based software is then used to sort and average the images to retrieve pristine structural information from a collection of noisy images. Acknowledging the heterogeneity in polymer samples prior to averaging is essential. Molecular conformations in a wide range of amphiphilic block copolymers, polymerized ionic liquids, and conjugated polymers can be gleaned from two-dimensional projections (2D), three-dimensional (3D) tomograms, and fourdimensional (4D) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) data sets where 2D diffraction patterns are taken as a function of position. Some methods such as phase contrast STEM have been used to image closely related materials such as metal-organic frameworks but not polymers. With improvements in hardware and software, such methods may soon be applied to polymers. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the strategies toward the high-resolution imaging of radiation sensitive polymer materials at different length scales.¬∫  [Jiang, Xi; Balsara, Nitash P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA‚Äú  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√ò  Jiang, X; Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  , XI/I-1439-2017  , XI/0000-0002-9589-7513√∫  Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program [KC11BN]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231] Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, o<    f the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))& Funding for this work was provided by the Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program (KC11BN), supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy, under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231.

The composite holey gold support for high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy of soft crystalline membranes was fabricated in two steps. In the first step, a holey gold film was transferred on top of a molybdenum grid. In the second step, a continuous thin carbon film was transferred onto the holey gold film. This support (Au/Mo grid) was used to image crystalline synthetic polymer membranes. The low thermal expansion of Mo is not only expected to avoid cryo-crinkling of the membrane when the grids are cooled to cryogenic temperatures, but it may also act to reduce whatever crinkling existed even before cooling. The Au/Mo grid exhibits excellent performance with specimens tilted to 45 degrees. This is demonstrated by quantifying beam-induced motion and differences in local defocus values. In addition, images of specimens on the Au/Mo grids that are tilted at 45 degrees show high-resolution information of the crystalline membranes that, after lattice-unbending, extends beyond 1.5 angstrom in the direction perpendicular to the tilt axis.¬• [Jiang, Xi; Balsara, Nitash P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xuan, Sunting; Zuckermann, Ronald N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Glaeser, Robert M.; Downing, Kenneth H.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Biophys & Integrated Bioimaging, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA5 United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeleya  Jiang, X (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  xijiang@lbl.gov√¥  Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy [KC11BN, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231] Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√¢ Funding for this work was provided by the Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program (KC11BN), supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy, under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Here we utilized the shape complementarity of sequence-defined peptoids to achieve selective assembly between peptoid chains. Three sets of self-complementary peptoids bearing different overall molecular shapes, determined by the monomer sequence (trapezoid, comb and zig-zag), were synthesized and systematically studied by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. All these peptoids crystallized in bulk into a nearly identical rectangular crystal lattice as evidenced by their similar melting temperatures and X-ray diffraction peaks. In aqueous solution, they all self-assembled into crystalline monolayer nanosheets with a known rectangular crystal lattice motif, regardless of their varied molecular shapes. These results suggest that complementary molecular shape could be a potential design element for the construction of more sophisticated, hierarchically-ordered peptoid nanomaterials that approach the structural and functional complexity found in biomacromolecular nanostructure.¬† [Xuan, Sunting; Jiang, Xi; Balsara, Nitash P.; Zuckermann, Ronald N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xuan, Sunting; Zuckermann, Ronald N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xuan, Sunting] Soochow Univ, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Soochow University - China; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√è  Zuckermann, RN (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zuckermann, RN (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  rnzuckermann@lbl.gov0  , XI/I-1439-2017; Zuckermann, Ronald/A-7606-2014@  , XI/0000-0002-9589-7513; Zuckermann, Ronald/0000-0002-3055-8860√∏  Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy [KC11BN, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231] Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy(United St<    ates Department of Energy (DOE)) Primary funding for this work was provided by the Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program (KC11BN), supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy, under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231.

While long-range order is enhanced by slowing down the self-assembly process, the dominant crystalline motif was found to be a sensitive function of both processing details and end group chemistry. In some cases, adjacent rows of polypeptoid molecules adopt anti-parallel V-shaped side chain conformations. In other cases, adjacent rows of polypeptoid molecules adopt parallel V-shaped side chain conformations. Interestingly, the unit cell is rectangular in both cases with dimensions a = 4.5 angstrom and c = 50 angstrom.

A series of sulfonated polystyrene-b-polyethylene-b-polystyrene (S-SES) membranes having the same nominal chemical composition but two different morphologies are prepared by systematic changes in processing. We start with a membrane comprising a mixture of homopolymer polystyrene (hPS) and a polystyrene-b-polyethylene-b-polystyrene (SES) copolymer. hPS is subsequently selectively removed from the membrane and the polystyrene domains are sulfonated to give S-SES membranes. The morphology of the membranes is controlled by controlling phi(v), the volume fraction of hPS in the blended membrane. The morphology of the membranes was studied by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM), and cryogenic electron tomography. The overall domain swelling measured by SAXS decreases slightly at phi(v) = 0.29; a crossover from lamellar to bicontinuous morphology is obtained at the same value of phi(v). The bicontinuous morphologies absorb more water than the lamellar morphologies. By contrast, the nanodomain swelling of the bicontinuous membrane (120%) is slightly less than that of the lamellar membrane (150%). Quantitative analysis of the STEM images and electron tomography was used to determine the swelling on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains due to exposure to water. The hydrophilic sulfonated polystyrene-rich domain spacing increases while the hydrophobic polyethylene domain spacing decreases when the membranes are hydrated. The extent of increase and decrease is not a strong function of phi(v). Published by AIP Publishing.* [Chen, X.

The hydrophobic/hydrophilic block ratio was varied keeping the total chain length of the co-polymers constant. A new approach for characterizing the vesicle membrane morphology based on low-dose cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is described. The individual low-dose micrographs cannot be interpreted directly due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Sorting and averaging techniques, developed in the context of protein structure determination, were thus applied to vesicle micrographs. Molecular dynamic simulations of the vesicles were used to establish the relationship between membrane morphology and averaged cryo-EM images. This approach enables resolution of the local thickness of the hydrophobic membrane core at the 1 nm length scale. The thickness of the hydrophobic core of the pNeh-b-pNpm membranes increases linearly with the length of the hydrophobic block.& [Jiang, Xi; Balsara, Nitash P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Spencer, Ryan K.; Ophus, Colin; Zuckermann, Ronald N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Downing, Kenneth H.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sun, Jing] Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Polymer Sci & Engn, Shandong Prov Educ Dept, Key Lab Biobased Polymer Mat, Qingdao 266042, Peoples R China; [Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAa United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Qingdao University of Science & Technology; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√é  Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  nbalsara@berkeley.edu≈∏  Zuckermann, Ronald N/A-7606-2014; Ophus, Colin/H-2350-2013; Zuckermann, Ronald/P-3436-2019; Sun, Jing/AAY-5961-2020; Ophus, Colin/P-5390-2019; , XI/I-1439-2017≈í  Zuckermann, Ronald N/0000-0002-3055-8860; Zuckermann, Ronald/0000-0002-3055-8860; Ophus, Colin/0000-0003-2348-8558; , XI/0000-0002-9589-7513√º  Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program [KC11BN]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231] Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√µ Funding for this work was provided by the Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program (KC11BN), supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy, under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231.

We have studied LiS batteries with a solid block copolymer electrolyte which exhibits improved stability against Li anodes. The electrolyte comprises a polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (SEO) copolymer doped with a Li salt. Hollow carbon nanospheres impregnated with sulfur were used to build a composite cathode. Two types of sulfur-impregnated functionalized carbon nanospheres were used: one with carboxylic acid groups and the other with short lithium poly(4-styrenesulfonyl (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (PSTFSI-Li) chains. Cells with Li2S8 dissolved in the SEO based electrolyte served as the baseline. After cycling, the reason for capacity fade was determined by imaging the batteries using synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography. It is generally assumed that LiS cells fail due to dissolution of polysulfide into the liquid electrolyte, i.e., the main problems related to the cathode. In our all-solid cells, failure was primarily due to delamination of the Li foil from the polymer electrolyte layer. Delamination is also observed at the sulfur cathode. It is likely that the large changes in volume of the active materials during cycling induce delamination in all-solid LiS cells. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society (ECS).

The simultaneous development of novel ARPES techniques, including nano/mu-ARPES, spin-resolved ARPES, and pump-probe ARPES mirrors the expansion in scanning modes for scanning tunneling microscopy, which made scanning probe methods the gold standard for driving insights into surface physics. In this paper, we introduce PyARPES, an open source and modular data analysis framework for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopies. We highlight PyARPES' current capabilities for the analysis of the large photoemission datasets created by nano-ARPES and pump-probe ARPES experiments, show how PyARPES fulfills current data analysis needs for ARPES analysis, and discuss prospects for the future of analysis techniques enabled by PyARPES.

X-RAY-STRUCTURE; PEPTOID NANOSHEETS; CRYO-EM; POLYMERS; DEFECTS[ Rational design of supramolecular nanomaterials fundamentally depends upon an atomic-level understanding of their structure and how it responds to chemical modifications. Here we studied a series of crystalline diblock copolypeptoids by a combination of sequence-controlled synthesis, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulation. This family of amphiphilic polypeptoids formed free-floating 2-dimensional monolayer nanosheets, in which individual polymer chains and their relative orientations could be directly observed. Furthermore, bromine atom side-chain substituents in nanosheets were directly visualized by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, revealing atomic details in position space inaccessible by conventional scattering techniques. While the polypeptoid backbone conformation was conserved across the set of molecules, the nanosheets exhibited different lattice packing geometries dependent on the aromatic side chain para substitutions. Peptoids are inherently achiral, yet we showed that sequences containing an asymmetric aromatic substitution pattern pack with alternating rows adopting opposite backbone chiralities. These atomic-level insights into peptoid nanosheet crystal structure provide guidance for the future design of bioinspired nanomaterials with more precisely controlled structures and properties. [Xuan, Sunting; Li, Nan K.; Prendergast, David; Zuckermann, Ronald N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xuan, Sunting; Jiang, Xi; Li, Nan K.; Prendergast, David; Balsara, Nitash P.; Zuckermann, Ronald N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Spencer, Ryan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Spencer, Ryan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAh United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Berkeley8 Zuckermann, RN (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720<     USA.;Balsara, NP; Zuckermann, RN (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.+  nbalsara@berkeley.edu; rnzuckermann@lbl.govP  Prendergast, David/E-4437-2010; , XI/I-1439-2017; Zuckermann, Ronald/A-7606-2014h  Prendergast, David/0000-0003-0598-1453; , XI/0000-0002-9589-7513; Zuckermann, Ronald/0000-0002-3055-8860√ø Primary funding for this work was provided by the Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program (KC11BN), supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy, under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Determining atomic-scale structures in these materials is difficult because they degrade rapidly when studied by electron microscopy, and techniques such as X-ray scattering average over volumes much larger than coherent blocks of the unit cells. We obtained cryo-electron microscopy images of self-assembled nanosheets of a peptoid polymer, made by solid-phase synthesis, in which we see a variety of crystalline motifs. A combination of crystallographic and single-particle methods, developed for cryo-electron microscopy of biological macromolecules, was used to obtain high-resolution images of the crystals. Individual crystals contain grains that are mirror images of each other with concomitant grain boundaries. We have used molecular dynamic simulations to build an atomic model of the crystal structure to facilitate the interpretation of electron micrographs. Direct visualization of crystalline grains and grain boundaries on atomic length scales represents a new level of information for the polymer field.r [Jiang, Xi; Greer, Douglas R.; Balsara, Nitash P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Greer, Douglas R.; Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kundu, Joyjit; Ophus, Colin; Minor, Andrew M.; Prendergast, David; Zuckermann, Ronald N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kundu, Joyjit] Duke Univ, Dept Chem, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Minor, Andrew M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Downing, Kenneth H.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Biophys & Integrated Bioimaging Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA≈† United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Duke University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryA Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Downing, KH (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Biophys & Integrated Bioimaging Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.(  nbalsara@berkeley.edu; khdowning@lbl.gov¬¶  Zuckermann, Ronald N/A-7606-2014; Prendergast, David/E-4437-2010; Ophus, Colin/P-5390-2019; Ophus, Colin/H-2350-2013; Zuckermann, Ronald/P-3436-2019; , XI/I-1439-2017√ó  Zuckermann, Ronald N/0000-0002-3055-8860; Prendergast, David/0000-0003-0598-1453; Ophus, Colin/0000-0003-2348-8558; Zuckermann, Ronald/0000-0002-3055-8860; , XI/0000-0002-9589-7513; Kundu, Joyjit/0000-0001-7736-6316¬Ø  Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy [KC11BN, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Bay Area Cryo-EM Consortium‚Äú  Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy; Bay Area Cryo-EM ConsortiumA Funding for this work was provided by the Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program (KC11BN), supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, U.S. Department of Energy, under contract DE-AC02-05CH11231.

We synthesized a series of polypeptoid diblock copolymers containing hydrophobic alkyl side chains and hydrophilic ethylene oxide side chains, systematically varying side-chain length (S), backbone main-chain length (N), block copolymer composition (n/m), and N-terminal group, and studied their thermal transitions by a combination of X-ray scattering and DSC. The thermal transitions are largely unaffected by S, N, and n/m but strongly affected by the N-terminal group. Block copolymers with an acetylated N-terminus exhibit two thermal transitions. The low temperature thermal transition is due to a transition from a crystalline phase to a sanidic liquid crystalline mesophase. The molecules adopt planar, boardlike conformations and are arranged in a rectangular crystal lattice with extended backbones that run parallel to each other. The side chains extend on either side and are located within the plane of the backbone. The liquid crystalline phase is characterized by conformational disorder in dimensions normal to the molecular plane. The high temperature thermal transition is due to melting of the liquid crystalline phase to give an isotropic phase. Block copolymers with a free N-terminus (non-acetylated) exhibit only one thermal transition and similar out-of-plane conformational disorder. This disorder appears to be due<     to a difference in the pendant side chain display angle of the terminal nitrogen atom.V [Greer, Douglas R.; Jiang, Xi; Balsara, Nitash P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Stolberg, Michael A.; Xuan, Sunting; Zuckermann, Ronald N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Molecular Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Greer, Douglas R.; Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√§  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley. Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zuckermann, RN (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Molecular Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.R  Zuckermann, Ronald/P-3436-2019; Zuckermann, Ronald N/A-7606-2014; , XI/I-1439-2017‚Äò  Zuckermann, Ronald/0000-0002-3055-8860; Zuckermann, Ronald N/0000-0002-3055-8860; , XI/0000-0002-9589-7513; Stolberg, Michael/0000-0001-9520-7204S Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy [KC11BN, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-76SF00515]9 Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))x The work was funded primarily by the Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program (KC11BN), supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy, under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231.

To verify the universality of this capping layer approach, the dewetting experiments are performed for single-layer graphene transferred onto polystyrene (PS), semiconducting thienoazacoronene (EH-TAC), gold, and also MoS2 on PS. Thermodynamic modeling indicates that the exceptionally high Young's modulus and surface conformity of 2D capping layers such as graphene and MoS2 substantially suppress surface fluctuations and thus dewetting. As long as the uncovered area is smaller than the fluctuation wavelength of the thin film in a dewetting process via spinodal decomposition, the dewetting should be suppressed. The 2D monolayer-capping approach opens up exciting new possibilities to enhance the thermal stability and expands the processing parameters for thin film materials without significantly altering their physical properties.¬Ø [Cao, Peigen; Omrani, Arash A.; Meaker, Kacey L.; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Yan, Aiming; Jung, Han Sae; Khajeh, Ramin; Rodgers, Griffin F.; Kim, Youngkyou; Aikawa, Andrew S.; Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bai, Peter; Xiao, Yihan] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bai, Peter; Xiao, Yihan; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kolaczkowski, Mattew A.; Liu, Yi] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ke; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAR University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California BerkeleyH Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF; Xu, T (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, K; Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;  xuk@berkeley.edu; crommie@berkeley.edu; tingxu@berkeley.edu≈†  /AAO-3375-2020; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/J-1682-2016; Rodgers, Griffin/D-7774-2019; Liu, yi/A-3384-2008; Xu, Ke/A-9476-2011¬Å  Tsai, Hsin-Zon/0000-0003-2097-0170; Rodgers, Griffin/0000-0003-0814-8467; Liu, yi/0000-0002-3954-6102; Xu, Ke/0000-0002-2788-194X/ Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Science and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104, KC1203]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1206512]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [P2ELP2-151852]N Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Science and Engineering Division; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))x P.C., P.B., and A.A.O. contributed equally to this work.

In general, the polypeptoid molecules adopt Vshaped configurations in the crystalline state, and adjacent molecules can pack with one another in either parallel or antiparallel arrangements, depending on the chemical composition. The halogen bond, which can have characteristic energies ranging from 1 to 5 kcal/mol, is commensurate with the parallel configuration. However, cryo-TEM images show that chains in the halogenated crystals were in the antiparallel configuration. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that positively charged a-holes, which are characteristic of halogen atoms covalently bonded to carbon atoms, play an important role in determining crystal geometry. Parallel and antiparallel configurations exhibited similar stability in simulations when standard force fields that only account for the electronegativity of halogen atoms were used. However, including the alpha-hole in the simulations resulted in a destabilization of the parallel configuration. This combination of imaging and simulation, which has played an important role in structural biology, has the potential to improve our understanding of factors that govern noncovalent interactions in synthetic materials.o [Seidler, Morgan; Balsara, Nitash P.; Jiang, Xi] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Seidler, Morgan; Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Nan K.; Luo, Xubo; Xuan, Sunting; Zuckermann, Ronald N.; Prendergast, David] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√â  Jiang, X (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Prendergast, D (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.&  dgprendergast@lbl.gov; xijiang@lbl.gov#  Seidler, Morgan/0000-0002-4719-8179K Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program [KC11BN]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation Graduate Student Research Fellowship [DGE 1752814]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02- 05CH11231]‚Äö Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation Graduate Student Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√Ö The authors acknowledge the support from the Soft Matter Electron Microscopy Program (KC11BN), supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy, under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231.

There remain fundamental questions regarding its nature and its relation to superconductivity. But to address these questions, we must first determine whether the pseudogap and superconducting states share a common property: particle-hole symmetry. We introduce a new technique to test<     particle-hole symmetry by using laser pulses tomanipulate and measure the chemical potential on picosecond time scales. The results strongly suggest that the asymmetry in the density of states is inverted in the pseudogap state, implying a particle-hole asymmetric gap. Independent of interpretation, these results can test theoretical predictions of the density of states in cuprates.¬ù [Miller, Tristan L.; Zhang, Wentao; Lanzara, Alessandra] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miller, Tristan L.; Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Eisaki, Hiroshi] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Elect & Photon Res Inst, Tsukuba 3058568, Japan; [Zhang, Wentao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China√π  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); Shanghai Jiao Tong University¬æ  Lanzara, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Lanzara, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  alanzara@lbl.govY  lanzara, alessandra/AAC-9535-2020; Eisaki, Hiroshi/F-6317-2018; ZHANG, Wentao/B-3626-2011F  Eisaki, Hiroshi/0000-0002-8299-6416; ZHANG, Wentao/0000-0001-8904-1252¬≥  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Ultrafast Materials Science Program [KC2203]¬ø  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Ultrafast Materials Science Program2 We thank J.

The polymer exhibits a lamellar morphology both in the neat state and in the presence of salt. However, the average grain size increases substantially when the electrolyte is heated above 113 degrees C. The grain structure of this sample changes reversibly with temperature, that is, smaller grains reappear when the electrolyte is cooled below 113 degrees C. While annealing block copolymers at high temperatures often leads to an increase in the grain size, this change is generally irreversible. The reason for the reversible change in the grain structure of the POSS-PEO-POSS/LiTFSI electrolyte is discussed. The ionic conductivity of the electrolyte also exhibits reversible changes in this temperature window. Knowledge of the grain structure is crucial for understanding ion transport in nanostructured electrolytes.¬ß [Chakraborty, Saheli; Balsara, Nitash P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hoffman, Zach J.; Balsara, Nitash P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Joint Ctr Energy Storage Res JCESR, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sethi, Gurmukh K.; Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hoffman, Zach J.; Balsara, Nitash P.; Villaluenga, Irune] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jiang, Xi; Sethi, Gurmukh K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhu, Chenhui] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ä United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory√ü Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Joint Ctr Energy Storage Res JCESR, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Balsara, NP; Villaluenga, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA..  nbalsara@berkeley.edu; irvillaluenga@gmail.com2  Villaluenga, Irune/ABH-5243-2020; , XI/I-1439-2017d  Villaluenga, Irune/0000-0002-1299-2479; , XI/0000-0002-9589-7513; Sethi, Gurmukh/0000-0002-8966-385Xb Office of Vehicle Technologies of the U.S. Department of Energy under the Battery Materials Research Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy [KC11BN, DE-AC0205CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-76SF00515];  [DEAC02-05CH11231]≈† Office of Vehicle Technologies of the U.S. Department of Energy under the Battery Materials Research Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); , Primary funding for this work was provided by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Vehicle Technologies of the U.S. Department of Energy, under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 under the Battery Materials Research Program.

One use of such predictions is to enable extraction of the underlying order parameter dynamics from experimental data, which is topical given the rapidly growing use of tr-ARPES in studying unconventional superconductivity. The methods considered model the two-time lesser Green's functions with an approximated lesser self-energy that describes relaxation by coupling of the system to two types of baths. The approach primarily used here also takes into consideration the relaxation of the excited states into equilibrium by explicitly including the level-broadening of the retarded and advanced Green's functions. We present equilibrium and nonequilibrium calculations of tr-ARPES spectrum from our model and discuss the signatures of different types of superconducting dynamics.‚Ä¶  [Xu, Tianrui] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAV  Xu, TR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.A  Morimoto, Takahiro/L-9826-2018; lanzara, alessandra/AAC-9535-2020(  Morimoto, Takahiro/0000-0003-4825-7377; √ñ  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) within the Ultrafast Materials Science Program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC2203]; EPiQS initiative of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation¬π  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) within the Ultrafast Materials Science Program; EPiQS initiative of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundationj We would like to thank A.

However, in all excitonic materials, exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) becomes the dominant loss mechanism at high densities. Typically, a macroscopic parameter named EEA coefficient (C-EEA) is used to compare EEA rates between materials at the same density; higher C-EEA implies higher EEA rate. Here, we find that the reported values of C-EEA for 140 different materials is inversely related to the single-exciton lifetime. Since during EEA one exciton must relax to ground state, C-EEA is proportional to the single-exciton recombination rate. This leads to the counterintuitive observation that the exciton density at which EEA starts to dominate is higher in a material with larger C-EEA. These results broaden our understanding of EEA across different material systems and provide a vantage point for future excitonic materials and devices.∆í [Uddin, Shiekh Zia; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Uddin, Shiekh Zia; Rabani, Eran; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rabani, Eran] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rabani, Eran] Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Ctr Computat Mol & Mat, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel√¨  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Tel Aviv University√Ü  Javey, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Javey, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  ajavey@berkeley.edu0  Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013; Rabani, Eran/M-1263-2013g  Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; Uddin, Shiekh Zia/0000-0002-1265-9940; Rabani, Eran/0000-0003-2031-3525 University of California Multicampus-National Laboratory Collaborative Research and Training program [LFRP-17-477237]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1201]

C.E  Theory of liquid-mediated strain release in two-dimensional materials  PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALSv  TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; CONTACT-ANGLE; PLASTIC-DEFORMATION; SURFACE; EQUILIBRIUM; CRITICALITY; TRANSITION; DYNAMICS√ë Strain engineering in transition metal dichalcogenides is an important means to manipulate these materials' electronic and optical properties. Recently, it has been shown that WSe2 monolayers grown on fused silica substrates using chemical vapor deposition can retain residual strain due to thermal expansion mismatch. Moreover, it was demonstrated that this strain can be released using a solvent-evaporation mediated decoupling method. A continuum theory to explain these observations is introduced and its predictions analyzed. The theory is used to establish that it is plausible that bonds much weaker than typical covalent bonds are sufficient to stabilize strains in the range of those experimentally observed. It is shown that the presence of the solvent modifies the equilibrium in-plane displacement of the film, while its lifting is negligible. Under the proper conditions, this displacement leads to an increase in the decoupling force, thereby initiating the strain relief process. The theory clarifies the role of the liquid surface tension in the relaxation process, and it identifies the relationships between droplet wetting behavior and initial strain state that will lead to solute-evaporation mediated decoupling.‚Ç¨ [Batiz, H.; Guo, Ji; Ager, J.

Ferrofluids, although reconfigurable, are paramagnetic at room temperature and lose their magnetization when the applied magnetic field is removed. Here, we show a reversible paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transformation of ferrofluid droplets by the jamming of a monolayer of magnetic nanoparticles assembled at the water-oil interface. These ferromagnetic liquid droplets exhibit a finite coercivity and remanent magnetization. They can be easily reconfigured into different shapes while preserving the magnetic properties of solid ferromagnets with classic north-south dipole interactions. Their translational and rotational motions can be actuated remotely and precisely by an external magnetic field, inspiring studies on active matter, energy-dissipative assemblies, and programmable liquid constructs.c [Liu, Xubo; Shi, Shaowei; Wang, Dong; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xubo; Kent, Noah; Streubel, Robert; Jiang, Yufeng; Chai, Yu; Kim, Paul Y.; Forth, Joe; Hellman, Frances; Helms, Brett A.; Ashby, Paul D.; Fischer, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kent, Noah; Fischer, Peter] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ceballos, Alejandro; Chai, Yu] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jiang, Yufeng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu; Helms, Brett A.; Ashby, Paul D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hellman, Frances] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Dong] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, WPI AIMR, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japand Beijing University of Chemical Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Tohoku UniversityQ Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, WPI AIMR, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.  tom.p.russell@gmail.comu  Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; Kim, Paul/GYV-3258-2022; Streubel, Robert/D-9686-2012; Fischer, Peter/A-3020-2010S Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Kim, Paul/0000-0003-0943-4924; Streubel, Robert/0000-0003-4783-892X; Fischer, Peter/0000-0002-9824-9343; Kent, Noah/0000-0003-2712-6239; Forth, Joe/0000-0001-7263-6364; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321; Jiang, Yufeng/0000-0002-1705-5863; Liu, Xubo/0000-0002-2231-0208; Shi, Shaowei/0000-0002-9869-4340√Ä U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division in the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division in the Non-equilibrium Magnetic Materials program (MSMAG) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Beijing NSF [2194083]; Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering at Beijing University of Chemical Technology; China Scholarship Council? U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division in the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division in the Non-equilibrium Magnetic Materials program (MSMAG)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Beijing NSF(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering at Beijing University of Chemical Technology; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)¬∫ This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (contract no.

Rashba spin-split quantum well states, 2D states that develop at the surface of strong spin-orbit coupling materials, are ideal given the tunability of their energy and spin states. So far, however, most studies have only demonstrated such control in a static way. In this study, we demonstrate control of the spin and energy degrees of freedom of surface quantum well states on Bi2Se3 at picosecond timescales. By means of a focused laser pulse, we modulate the band-bending, producing picosecond time-varying electric fields at the material's surface, thereby reversibly modulating the quantum well spectrum and Rashba effect. Moreover, we uncover a dynamic quasi-Fermi level, dependent on the Lifshitz transition of the second quantum well band bottom. These results open a pathway for light-driven spintronic devices with ultrafast switching of electronic phases, and offer the interesting prospect to extend this ultrafast photo-gating technique to a broader host of 2D materials. [Ciocys, Samuel T.; Maksimovic, Nikola; Analytis, James G.; Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ciocys, Samuel T.; Maksimovic, Nikola; Analytis, James G.; Lanzara, Alessandra] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ñ  Ciocys, ST; Lanzara, <    A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Ciocys, ST; Lanzara, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.&  sciocys@berkeley.edu; alanzara@lbl.gov√©  Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy, Ultrafast Materials Science Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC2203]; National Science Foundation [1905397] Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy, Ultrafast Materials Science Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))2 The authors would like to thank Kayla Currier, Daniel Eilbott, Chiu-Yun Lin, Nicholas Dale, and Conrad Stansbury for critical discussions on the experiment and analysis.

However, conventional silicon light emitting diodes emit photons with energies near the band edge where the corresponding silicon photodetectors lack responsivity. On the other hand, previously reported hot carrier electroluminescent silicon devices utilizing a reverse biased diode require high operating voltages. Here, we investigate hot carrier electroluminescence in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors operating under transient voltage conditions. During each voltage transient, large energy band bending is created at the edge of the source contact, much larger than what is achievable at a steady state. As a result, electrons and holes are injected efficiently from a single source contact into the silicon channel at the corresponding voltage transient, where they subsequently undergo impact ionization and phonon-assisted interband recombination. Notably, we show low voltage operation down to 2.8 V by using a 20 nm thick high- kappa gate dielectric.

Evidence for strong electron-boson coupling is observed in cuprates with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), in the form of a dispersion kink and peak-dip-hump structure. What is missing is evidence of a causal relation to superconductivity. Here we revisit the problem using the technique of time-resolved ARPES on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta. We focus on the peak-dip-hump structure, and show that laser pulses shift spectral weight into the dip as superconductivity is destroyed on picosecond time scales. We compare our results to simulations of Eliashberg theory in a superconductor with an Einstein boson, and find that the magnitude of the shift in spectral weight depends on the degree to which the bosonic mode contributes to superconductivity. Further study could address one of the longstanding mysteries of high-temperature superconductivity.√ä [Miller, Tristan L.; Ma, Jonathan; Moore, Joel E.; Lanzara, Alessandra] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miller, Tristan L.; Ma, Jonathan; Moore, Joel E.; Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Wentao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Eisaki, Hiroshi] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Elect & Photon Res Inst, Tsukuba 3058568, Japan√π  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST)Y  ZHANG, Wentao/B-3626-2011; lanzara, alessandra/AAC-9535-2020; Eisaki, Hiroshi/F-6317-2018F  ZHANG, Wentao/0000-0001-8904-1252; Eisaki, Hiroshi/0000-0002-8299-6416: We thank A.

The resulting resources are databases such as the Materials Project (www.materialsproject.org), which is harnessing the power of supercomputing together with state-of-the-art quantum mechanical theory to compute the properties of all known inorganic materials, to design novel materials, and to make the data available for free to the community, together with online analysis and design algorithms.

The software infrastructure carries out thousands of calculations per week, enabling screening and predictions for both novel solids as well as molecular species with targeted properties. As the rapid growth of accessible computed materials properties continues, the next frontier is harnessing that information for automated learning and accelerated discovery.

To exploit the anisotropic and thickness-dependent behavior, it is important to realize orientated growth of ultrathin tellurium. Here, van der Waals epitaxial growth of Te on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is systematically investigated. Orientated growth of Te with a thickness down to 5 nm is realized on three-fold symmetric substrates (WSe2, WS2, MoSe2, and MoS2), where the atomic chains of Te are aligned with the armchair directions of substrates. 1D/2D moire superlattices are observed for the Te/WSe2 heterostructure. This method is extended to the growth of SeTe alloys, providing flexibility for band engineering. Finally, growth of textured Te film is demonstrated on the lower-symmetry surface of WTe2.√® [Zhao, Chunsong; Ji, Wenbo; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Chunsong; Ji, Wenbo; Scott, Mary C.; Chrzan, Daryl C.; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Chunsong; Batiz, Humberto; Yasar, Bengisu; Ji, Wenbo; Scott, Mary C.; Chrzan, Daryl C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Scott, Mary C.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA( University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory¬∞ Javey, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Scott, MC; Chrzan, DC; Javey, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Scott, MC; Chrzan, DC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Scott, MC (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.E  mary.scotte@berkeley.edu; dcchrzan@berkeley.edu; ajaveye@berkeley.edu-  Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013; Wang, Min/R-2816-2016¬Æ  Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; Wang, Min/0000-0003-1478-6051; Batiz Guerrero, Humberto/0000-0001-9320-013X; Sari, Bengisu/0000-0002-4421-7098; Zhao, Cong/0000-0002-5697-3632$ US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Electronic Materials Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1201]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]H US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Electronic Materials Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√û Synthesis work was supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 within the Electronic Materials Program (No. KC1201).

Charged excitons formed in t<    he presence of background carriers mainly recombine nonradiatively. Neutral excitons recombine completely radiatively at low generation rates, but experience nonradiative exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) at high generation rates. Strain can suppress EEA, resulting in near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) at all exciton densities. Although exciton diffusion is the primary channel of energy transport in excitonic materials and a critical optoelectronic design consideration, the combined effects of these factors on exciton diffusion are not clearly understood. In this work, we decouple the diffusion of neutral and charged excitons with chemical counterdoping and explore the effect of strain and generation rate on exciton diffusion. According to the standard semiconductor paradigm, a shorter carrier recombination lifetime should lead to a smaller diffusion length. Surprisingly, we find that increasing generation rate shortens the exciton lifetime but increases the diffusion length in unstrained monolayers of TMDCs. When we suppress EEA by strain, both lifetime and diffusion length become independent of generation rate. During EEA one exciton nonradiatively recombines and kinetically energizes another exciton, which then diffuses fast. Our results probe concentration-dependent diffusion of pure neutral excitons by counterdoping and elucidate how strain controls exciton transport and many-body interactions in TMDC monolayers. [Uddin, Shiekh Zia; Higashitarumizu, Naoki; Kim, Hyungjin; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Uddin, Shiekh Zia; Higashitarumizu, Naoki; Kim, Hyungjin; Chrzan, Daryl; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yi, Jun; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Xiang] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chrzan, Daryl] Univ Calif Berkeley, Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAW University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; National Science Foundation (NSF); University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Hong Kong; University of California System; University of California Berkeley0  Zhang, Xiang/F-6905-2011; Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013E  Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; Uddin, Shiekh Zia/0000-0002-1265-9940√É  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC1201]; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceH U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)R This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under contract no.

However, graphene made with scalable fabrication techniques is polycrystalline and contains inherent nanoscale line and point defects-grain boundaries and grain-boundary triple junctions-that lead to significant statistical fluctuations in toughness and strength. These fluctuations become particularly pronounced for nanocrystalline graphene where the density of defects is high. Here we use large-scale simulation and continuum modelling to show that the statistical variation in toughness and strength can be understood with 'weakest-link' statistics. We develop the first statistical theory of toughness in polycrystalline graphene, and elucidate the nanoscale origins of the grain-size dependence of its strength and toughness. Our results should lead to more reliable graphene device design, and provide a framework to interpret experimental results in a broad class of two-dimensional materials.Q [Shekhawat, Ashivni; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shekhawat, Ashivni; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 324 Hearst Mem Min Bldg,MC 1760, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shekhawat, Ashivni] Miller Inst Basic Res Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ó  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeleyt Shekhawat, A; Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Shekhawat, A; Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 324 Hearst Mem Min Bldg,MC 1760, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Shekhawat, A (corresponding author), Miller Inst Basic Res Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA..  shekhawat.ashivni@gmail.com; roritchie@lbl.gov  Ritchie, Robert O/A-8066-2008%  Ritchie, Robert O/0000-0002-0501-6998H Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Program at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [KC13, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, at the University of California, Berkeley. Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Program at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division; Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, at the University of California, Berkeley√¢ This work was supported by the Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

However, studies to date have utilized laser-based measurements to extract device performance and the responsivity of these detectors. As such, their performance under thermal radiation and spectral response has not been fully characterized. Here, we perform a systematic investigation of gated-photoconductors based on b-PAs alloys as a function of thickness over the <    composition range of 0-91% As. Infrared transmission and reflection measurements are performed to determine the bandgap of the various compositions. The spectrally resolved photoresponse for various compositions in this material system is investigated to confirm absorption measurements, and we find that the cutoff wavelength can be tuned from 3.9 to 4.6 mu m over the studied compositional range. In addition, we investigated the temperature-dependent photoresponse and performed calibrated responsivity measurements using blackbody flood illumination. Notably, we find that the specific detectivity (D*) can be optimized by adjusting the thickness of the b-P/b-PAs layer to maximize absorption and minimize dark current. We obtain a peak D* of 6 x 10(10) cm Hz(1/2) W-1 and 2.4 x 10(10) cm Hz(1/2) W-1 for pure b-P and b-PAs (91% As), respectively, at room temperature, which is an order of magnitude higher than commercially available mid-wave infrared detectors operating at room temperature. [Amani, Matin; Regan, Emma; Bullock, James; Ahn, Geun Ho; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Amani, Matin; Regan, Emma; Bullock, James; Ahn, Geun Ho; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA2  Bullock, James/T-8182-2018; Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013B  Bullock, James/0000-0001-7903-9642; Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931√∏  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [HR0011-16-1-0004]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within Electronic Materials Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1201] Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within Electronic Materials Program√¨ The authors would like to acknowledge P.

Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as monolayer MoS2, often exhibit low PL QY for as-processed samples, which has typically been attributed to a large native defect density. We show that the PL QY of as-processed MoS2 and WS2 monolayers reaches near-unity when they are made intrinsic through electrostatic doping, without any chemical passivation. Surprisingly, neutral exciton recombination is entirely radiative even in the presence of a high native defect density.

Nonradiative processes proportionately reduce photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a performance metric that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Although transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers exhibit near-unity PL QY at low exciton densities, nonradiative exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) enhanced by van-Hove singularity (VHS) rapidly degrades their PL QY at high exciton densities and limits their utility in practical applications. Here, by applying small mechanical strain (less than 1%), we circumvented VHS resonance and markedly suppressed EEA in monolayer TMDCs, resulting in near-unity PL QY at all exciton densities despite the presence of a high native defect density. Our findings can enable light-emitting devices that retain high efficiency at all brightness levels.√ë [Kim, Hyungjin; Uddin, Shiekh Zia; Higashitarumizu, Naoki; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kim, Hyungjin; Uddin, Shiekh Zia; Higashitarumizu, Naoki; Rabani, Eran; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rabani, Eran] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rabani, Eran] Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Ctr Computat Mol & Mat, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC1201, KC3103]; Samsung Scholarship; Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research Abroad of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science" U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Samsung Scholarship(Samsung); Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research Abroad of the Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceÀú This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

There has been a lot of recent interest in the development and applications of liquid phase environmental TEM. In this Account, we review the development and applications of liquid cell TEM for the study of dynamic phenomena at liquid solid interfaces, focusing on two areas: (1) nucleation, growth, and self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals and (2) electrode electrolyte interfaces during charge and discharge processes. We highlight the achievements and progress that have been made in these two topical areas of our studies. For example, tracking single platinum particle growth trajectories revealed that two different pathways of growth, either by monomer attachment or coalescence between nanoparticles, led to the same particle size. With the improved spatial resolution and fast electron detection, we were able to trace individual facet development during platinum nanocube platinum nanocube growth. The results showed that different from the surface energy minimization rule prediction, the growth rates of all low-energy facets, such as {100}, 1114 and {111}, were similar. The {100} facets stopped growth early, and the continuous growth of the rest facets resulted in a nanocube. Density functional theory calculations showed that the amine ligands with low mobility on the {100} facets blocked the further growth of the facets. The effect of the ligand on nanoparticle shape evolution were further studied systematically using a Pt-Fe nanoparticle system by changing the oleylamine concentration. With 20%, 30%, or 50% oleylamine, Pt-Fe nanowires or nanoparticles with different morphologies and stabilities were achieved. Real-time imaging of nanoparticles in solution also enabled the study of interactions between nanoparticles during self-assembly. We further compared the study of noble-metal nanoparticles and transition-metal oxides in a liquid cell to elucidate the nanoparticle formation mechanisms. In the second part of this Account, we review the study of electrolyte electrode interfaces by the development of electrochemical liquid cell TEM. The formation of single-crystalline Pb dendrites from polycrystalline branches and Li dendrite growth in a commercial electrolyte for Li ion batteries were observed. We also studied lithiation reactions of MoS2 and Au electrodes. MoS2 nanoflakes on the Ti electrode underwent irreversible decomposition, resulting in the vanishing of the MoS2 active nanoflakes. More detailed study using nanobeam diffraction indicated that the MoS2 nanoflakes were broken down into small nanoparticles as a result of the fast discharge. For the lithiation of Au electrodes, three distinct types of morphology changes during reactions were revealed, including gradual dissolution, explosive reaction, and local expansion/shrinkage. Additionally, we studied electrolyte decomposition reactions such as bubble formation and solid electrolyte interphase formation. At the end, our perspective on the challenges and opportunities in the applications of liquid phase environmental TEM for the study of liquid chemical reactions is provided. [Zeng, Zhiyuan; Zheng, Wenjing; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Wenjing] Tianjin Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬ß  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Tianjin University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√Ü  Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  hmzheng@lbl.gov  zeng, zhiyuan/G-7571-2015D  zeng, zhiyuan/0000-0001-7483-1438; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170¬©  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH Program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]‚Äù  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH Program√ú  We acknowledge the support from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the KC22ZH Program.	  0001-4842	  1520-4898  ACCOUNTS CHEM RES  Accounts Chem.

Structured liquids can be crafted by the jamming of interfacial assemblies of nanoparticle (NP) surfactants. Due to the interactions between functional groups on nanoparticles dispersed in one liquid and polymers having complementary end-functionality dissolved in a second immiscible fluid, the anchor<    ing of a well-defined number of polymer chains onto the NPs leads to the formation of NP surfactants that assemble at the interface and reduce the interfacial energy. Microfluidic techniques provide a simple and versatile route to produce one liquid phase in a second where the shape of the dispersed liquid phase can range from droplets to tubules depending on the flow conditions and the interfacial energies. In this study, the effect of NP surfactants on Plateau-Rayleigh (PR) instabilities of a free-falling jet of an aqueous dispersion of carboxylic acid functionalized silica NPs into a toluene phase containing amine-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS-NH2) is investigated. NP surfactants were found to significantly affect the breakup of laminar liquid jets, resulting in longer jet breakup lengths and dripping to jetting flow transitions.4 [Toor, Anju] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, 6141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Toor, Anju; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R ChinaX University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology‚Ç¨ Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.U  Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Toor, Anju/AAP-4939-2021J  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Helms, Brett/0000-0003-3925-4174¬Ø  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]‚Äô  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program√≠  This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under Award under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).  10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00556  EU8RX  WOS:000401307300055(  Toor, A; Lamb, S; Helms, BA; Russell, TP;  Toor, Anju; Lamb, Sean; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.K  Reconfigurable Microfluidic Droplets Stabilized by Nanoparticle SurfactantsR  microfluidics; surfactants; interfacial assembly; nanoparticles; droplet formation√ê Interfacial assemblies of nanoparticles can stabilize liquid liquid interfaces.

We have developed droplet interfaces covered with elastic, responsive monolayers of NP-surfactants. Due to the presence of an elastic layer at the interface, the droplets offer a greater resistance to coalescence and can prevent the exchange of materials across interfaces. Our results show the successful encapsulation of nanoparticles, dyes, and proteins with diameters in the 2.4-30 nm range. Further, we show that stable water-in-oil droplets can be generated for various combinations of polymer ligands and nanoparticles bearing complementary functionalities. These NP-surfactant-stabilized microfluidic emulsions would enable applications requiring liquid liquid interfaces that can adapt and respond to external stimuli and whose mechanical properties can be easily tailored. [Toor, Anju; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab1, Mat Sci Div, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lamb, Sean] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology¬Å Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab1, Mat Sci Div, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.U  Toor, Anju/AAP-4939-2021; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019¬∞  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]¬Ω  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√¢  This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).  MAR  10.1021/acsnano.7b07635  GB3QN  WOS:000428972600028%  Liang, QH; Dwaraknath, S; Persson, KA6  Liang, Qiaohao; Dwaraknath, Shyam; Persson, Kristin A.;  High-throughput computation and evaluation of raman spectra  SCIENTIFIC DATAY  INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; APPROXIMATION; DATABASES; INTERFACE√Ø Raman spectroscopy is used ubiquitously in the characterization of condensed materials, spanning from biomaterials, minerals to polymers, as it provides a unique fingerprint of local bonding and environment.

However, the effects of a solid-liquid interface on NP motion and on the interactions between these NPs is still not well understood. Here, using in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we directly observed the movement of gold NPs and their aggregation dynamics at solid-liquid interfaces. We found that the solid surfaces transiently pin the NPs during their aggregation, dampening their translational and rotational movements. This surface pinning reduces both the movement of NPs and their aggregation rate as the aggregates grow by attachment. However, the pinning of the NP aggregates affects their translational and rotational motions differently. Initially, with increasing aggregate size, the aggregate's translational motion dampens more than its rotational motion. Consequently, the initial aggregation stages are driven by both the translational and rotational motions, whereas the rotational motion dominates the later aggregation stages. Our results provide insight into the movements of NPs and their aggregates at solid-liquid interfaces, which may assist in the future design and control of NP assemblies at interfaces.u [Tian, Xuezeng; Mirsaidov, Utkur] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr BioImaging Sci, Singapore 117557, Singapore; [Tian, Xuezeng; Zheng, Haimei] Berkeley Educ Alliance Res Singapore, Singapore 138602, Singapore; [Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mirsaidov, Utkur] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117551, Singapore; [Mirsaidov, Utkur] Natl Univ Singapore, NUSNNI NanoCore, Singapore 117411, Singapore; [Mirsaidov, Utkur] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Adv Mat 2D, Singapore 117546, Singapore National University of Singapore; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore¬™ Mirsaidov, U (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr BioImaging Sci, Singapore 117557, Singapore.;Mirsaidov, U (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117551, Singapore.;Mirsaidov, U (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, NUSNNI NanoCore, Singapore 117411, Singapore.;Mirsaidov, U (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Adv Mat 2D, Singapore 117546, Singapore.  mirsaidov@nus.edu.sg7  Mirsaidov, Utkur/A-6552-2012; Tian, Xuezeng/F-7845-2010j  Mirsaidov, Utkur/0000-0001-8673-466X; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Tian, Xuezeng/0000-0002-4563-1960¬æ  Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2 [MOE2015-T2-1007]; U.

The exciton diffusion length is a critical parameter that reflects the quality of exciton transport in monolayer TMDCs and limits the performance of many excitonic devices. Although diffusion lengths of a few hundred nanometers have been reported in the literature for asexfoliated monolayers, these measurements are convoluted by neutral and charged excitons (trions) that coexist at room. temperature due to natural background doping. Untangling the diffusion of neutral excitons and trionsusingis paramount to understand the fundamental limits and potential of new optoelectronic device architectures made possible TMDCs.

Among the MWIR light sources, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have the advantages of simple design, room-temperature operation, and low cost. Owing to the low Auger recombination at high carrier densities and direct bandgap of black phosphorus (bP), it can serve as a high quantum efficiency emitting layer in LEDs. In this work, we demonstrate bP-LEDs exhibiting high external quantum efficiencies and wall-plug efficiencies of up to 4.43 and 1.78%, respectively. This is achieved by integrating the device with an Al2O3/Au optical cavity, which enhances the emission efficiency, and a thin transparent conducing oxide [indium tin oxide (ITO)] layer, which reduces the parasitic resistance, both resulting in order of magnitude improvements to performance.{ [Gupta, Niharika; Kim, Hyungjin; Uddin, Shiekh Zia; Lien, Der-Hsien; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gupta, Niharika; Kim, Hyungjin; Uddin, Shiekh Zia; Lien, Der-Hsien; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Azar, Nima Sefidmooye; Crozier, Kenneth B.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Azar, Nima Sefidmooye; Crozier, Kenneth B.] Univ Melbourne, Australian Res Council ARC Ctr Excellence Transfo, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Crozier, Kenneth B.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Phys, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia√û  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne5  Lien, Der-Hsien/GYD-6547-2022; Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013¬è  Lien, Der-Hsien/0000-0001-6774-2074; Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; Uddin, Shiekh Zia/0000-0002-1265-9940; Gupta, Niharika/0000-0002-1053-5821 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC1201]; Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Transformative Meta-Optical Systems [CE200100010]; ARC [DP210103428]C U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Transformative Meta-Optical Systems(Australian Research Council); ARC(Australian Research Council)¬≤ The work at Berkeley was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (EMAT Program KC1201).

To date, steady-state monolayer light-emitting devices suffer from Schottky contacts or require complex heterostructures. We demonstrate a transient-mode electro-luminescent device based on transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2) to overcome these problems. Electroluminescence from this dopant-free two-terminal device is obtained by applying an AC voltage between the gate and the semiconductor. Notably, the electroluminescence intensity is weakly dependent on the Schottky barrier height or polarity of the contact. We fabricate a monolayer seven-segment display and achieve the first transparent and bright millimeter-scale light-emitting monolayer semiconductor device.¬∑ [Lien, Der-Hsien; Amani, Matin; Desai, Sujay B.; Ahn, Geun Ho; Han, Kevin; Wu, Ming C.; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lien, Der-Hsien; Amani, Matin; Desai, Sujay B.; Ahn, Geun Ho; Ager, Joel W., III; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [He, Jr-Hau] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia√Ö  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology}  He, Jr-Hau/Y-2620-2019; Lien, Der-Hsien/GYD-6547-2022; He, Jr-Hau/B-5141-2011; Wu, Ming C/J-9906-2012; Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013 He, Jr-Hau/0000-0003-1886-9241; Lien, Der-Hsien/0000-0001-6774-2074; He, Jr-Hau/0000-0003-1886-9241; Wu, Ming C/0000-0003-4808-6686; Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; Ager, Joel/0000-0001-9334-9751; Ahn, Geun Ho/0000-0002-4761-7804; Han, Kevin/0000-0002-4028-2108√§  National Science Foundation (NSF) [1623038]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office ofBasic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1201]; Lam Research Graduate Fellowship National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office ofBasic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Lam Research Graduate Fellowship√¢ We thank A.B.

Understanding the short- and medium-range ordering of the amorphous structure and the fundamental physics governing the crystallization of the films is crucial. Although the lack of long range crystalline order restricts the characterization of the amorphous films, electron microscopy offers a way to extract information about the nanoscale ordering. In this paper, the local ordering of amorphous TexSe1-x thin films with x = 0.22 , 0.61 , 0.70 , 0.90 , and 1 grown by thermal evaporation is investigated using radial distribution function (RDF) and fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM) analysis. RDF results show that the nearest-neighbor distances of selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) in their crystalline structure are preserved, and their bond lengths increase with the addition of Te. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict structures with interatomic distances similar to those measured experimentally. Additionally, fluctuations in atomic coordination are analyzed. Medium range order (MRO) analysis obtained from FEM and DFT calculations suggests that there are at least two po<    pulations within the chain network structure, which are close to the Se-Se and Te-Te intrachain distances. For the binary alloy with x > 0.61, TexSe1-x, Te-Te like populations increase and Te fragments might form, suggesting that the glass forming ability decreases rapidly.

In particular, one of the first reported HEAs, the equiatomic, single-phase, face-centered cubic (fcc) alloy CrMnFeCoNi, often termed the Cantor alloy, has been shown to display an exceptional combination of strength, ductility and fracture toughness, Le., damage tolerance, at room temperature, properties that are further enhanced at cryogenic temperatures. Despite this alloy being the most studied HEA to date, its resistance to crack growth under cyclic fatigue loading has not yet been characterized. Here, we examine its fatigue-crack propagation behavior, primarily at lower, near-threshold, growth rates, both at room temperature (293 K) and at 198 K. At 293 K, the alloy shows a fatigue threshold, Delta K-TH, of similar to 4.8 MPa root m, which increases by more than 30% to Delta K-TH similar to 6.3 MPa root m with decrease in temperature to 198 K; additionally, the Paris exponent m was found to increase from roughly 3.5 to 4.5 with decreasing temperature. Examination of the fracture surfaces and crack paths indicate a transition from predominantly transgranular crack propagation at room temperature to intergranular-dominated failure at the lower temperature. Such a change in crack path is generally associated with an increasing degree of physical contact between the two fracture surfaces, Le., roughness-induced fatigue crack closure, which is likely to be the main reason for the difference in the measured thresholds. Additionally, we believe that the higher thresholds found at 198 K are associated with the alloy's higher strength at lower temperatures, which both reduces the crack-tip opening displacements at a given stress-intensity range and prevents plastic deformations of the grains in the wake of the crack. At room temperature, such plastically deformed grains can be associated with a loss of contact shielding of the crack-tip through closure, resulting in a lower threshold compared to 198 K. [Thurston, Keli V.

In the model CDW system 1T-TiSe2 such a gap opens up between its Se-4p valence and Ti-3d conduction band, accompanied by a change of dispersion. These changes are crucial in understanding the CDW phase, as they provide a measure of the Se-4p-Ti-3d hybridization strength and characteristic mechanistic features. Using time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (trARPES), the unoccupied band structure is populated with near-infrared (NIR) pump pulses which allows to directly visualize the parabolically-shaped Ti-3d conduction band. Furthermore, we observe a transient change of effective mass in the Se-4p valence band following photoexcitation. This occurs alongside an overall reduction due to weakening of the CDW phase and is accompanied by an oscillating component with the frequency of the characteristic A(1g) phonon. These observations, enabled by trAPRES, highlight the importance of the lattice contributions in establishing the CDW order in 1T-TiSe2.√§ [Huber, Maximilian; Lin, Yi; Dale, Nicholas; Kaindl, Robert A.; Lanzara, Alessandra] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dale, Nicholas; Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Phys Dept, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sailus, Renee; Tongay, Sefaattin] Arizona State Univ, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Kaindl, Robert A.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Phys, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kaindl, Robert A.] Arizona State Univ, CXFEL Labs, Tempe, AZ 85287 USAA United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempec  Lanzara, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  Tongay, Sefaattin/ACQ-5306-2022f  Tongay, Sefaattin/0000-0001-8294-984X; Dale, Nicholas/0000-0001-8432-2135; Lin, Yi/0000-0003-0806-4538¬æ  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) , Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC2203]; NSF [DMR 2111812, CMMI 1933214]√ì  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) , Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))o This work was primarily funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) , Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

This principle is employed for the manufacturing of devices ranging from high-performance transistors to solid-state lasers. Traditionally, strain is typically achieved via growth on lattice-mismatched substrates. For two-dimensional (2D)semiconductors, this is not feasible as they typically do not interact epitaxially with the substrate. Here, we demonstrate controlled strain engineering of 2D semiconductors during synthesis by utilizing the thermal coefficient of expansion mismatch between the substrate and semiconductor. Using WSe2 as a model system, we demonstrate stable built-in strains ranging from 1% tensile to 0.2% compressive on substrates with different thermal coefficient of expansion. Consequently, we observe a dramatic modulation of the band structure, manifested by a strain-driven indirect-to-direct bandgap transition and brightening of the dark exciton in bilayer and monolayer WSe2, respectively. The growth method developed here should enable flexibility in design of more sophisticated devices based on 2D materials.¬∫ [Ahn, Geun Ho; Amani, Matin; Lien, Der-Hsien; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ahn, Geun Ho; Amani, Matin; Rasool, Haider; Lien, Der-Hsien; Mastandrea, James P.; Ager, Joel W., III; Chrzan, Daryl C.; Minor, Andrew M.; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rasool, Haider; Mastandrea, James P.; Ager, Joel W., III; Chrzan, Daryl C.; Minor, Andrew M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rasool, Haider; Minor, Andrew M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Natl Ctr Elect Microscopy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dubey, Madan] US Army Res Lab, 2800 Powder Mill Rd, Adelphi, MD 20783 USA√Ç University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; US Army Research, Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM); US Army Research Laboratory (ARL)  ajavey@eecs.berkeley.eduN  Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Lien, Der-Hsien/GYD-6547-2022c  Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; Lien, Der-Hsien/0000-0001-6774-2074; Ager, Joel/0000-0001-9334-9751( U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Electronic Materials Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1201]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]L U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Electronic Materials Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))d The authors would like to thank Ian S.

Ferromagnetic liquids obtain their physical and magnetic properties, including a remanent magnetization that distinguishes them from ferrofluids, from the jamming of magnetic nanoparticles assembled at the interface between two distinct liquids to minimize surface tension. This perspective provides an overview of recent progress and discusses future directions, challenges and potential applications of jamming magnetic nanoparticles with regard to 3D nano-magnetism. We address the formation and characterization of curved magnetic geometries, and spin frustration between dipole-coupled nanostructures, and advance our understanding of particle jamming at liquid-liquid interfaces.¬π [Streubel, Robert; Liu, Xubo; Wu, Xuefei; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Streubel, Robert] Univ Nebraska, Dept Phys & Astron, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Liu, Xubo; Wu, Xuefei; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xubo] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Bioinspired Mat & Interfacial Sci, Tech Inst Phys & Chem, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, WPI Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japanc United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Technical Institute of Physics & Chemistry, CAS; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Tohoku University√∞ Streubel, R; Liu, XB (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Streubel, R (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Phys & Astron, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.;Liu, XB (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Liu, XB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Bioinspired Mat & Interfacial Sci, Tech Inst Phys & Chem, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.O  streubel@lbl.gov; xuboliu@mail.ipc.ac.cn; wuxuefei06@163.com; tprussell@lbl.gov@  Streubel, Robert/D-9686-2012; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022m  Streubel, Robert/0000-0003-4783-892X; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Liu, Xubo/0000-0002-2231-0208‚Äî  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]5 This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16) and the NEMM program (MSMAG).  MDPI  BASEL.

Unlike conventional emulsions, microemulsions form spontaneously, have a monodisperse droplet size that can be controlled by adjusting the surfactant concentration, and do not degrade with time. To make microemulsions, a judicious choice of surfactant molecules must be made, which significantly limits their potential use. Nanoparticle surfactants, on the other hand, are a promising alternative because the surface chemistry needed to make them bind to a liquid-liquid interface is both well flexible and understood. Here, we derive a thermodynamic model predicting the conditions in which nanoparticle surfactants drive spontaneous emulsification that agrees quantitatively with experiments using Noria nanoparticles. This new class of microemulsions inherits the mechanical, chemical, and optical properties of the nanoparticles used to form them, leading to novel applications.K [Hasnain, J.; Jiang, Y.; Hou, H.; Yan, J.; Forth, J.; Ashby, P.

However, both recent advances in high-throughput material exploration and increasing complexity of materials of interest for electrochemical applications pose challenges for performing Pourbaix analysis on multidimensional systems. Specifically, current Pourbaix con<    struction algorithms incur significant computational costs for systems consisting of four or more elemental components. Herein, we propose an alternative Pourbaix construction method that filters all potential combinations of species in a system to only those present on a compositional convex hull. By including axes representing the quantities of H+ and e(-) required to form a given phase, one can ensure every stable phase mixture is included in the Pourbaix diagram and reduce the computational time required to construct the resultant Pourbaix diagram by several orders of magnitude. This new Pourbaix algorithm has been incorporated into the pymatgen code and the Materials Project website, and it extends the ability to evaluate the Pourbaix stability of complex multicomponent systems.¬ç [Patel, Anjli M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Norskov, Jens K.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Phys, Lyngby, Denmark; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Montoya, Joseph H.] Toyota Res Inst, 4440 El Camino Real, Los Altos, CA 94022 USA' Stanford University; Technical University of Denmark; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Toyota Motor Corporationb  Montoya, JH (corresponding author), Toyota Res Inst, 4440 El Camino Real, Los Altos, CA 94022 USA.  joseph.montoya@tri.globalB  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Norskov, Jens K/D-2539-2017H  Norskov, Jens K/0000-0002-4427-7728; Montoya, Joseph/0000-0001-5760-2860n Toyota Research Institute (TRI) through the SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis; Accelerated Materials Design and Discovery (AMDD) program through the SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC23MP]| Toyota Research Institute (TRI) through the SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis; Accelerated Materials Design and Discovery (AMDD) program through the SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√π The authors acknowledge the Toyota Research Institute (TRI) and the Accelerated Materials Design and Discovery (AMDD) program for support through the SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP).

When choosing such a material as the hole-selective contact (p-layer), the alignment of the material's valence band edge energy (E-VB) with that of crystalline silicon (c-Si) is an important criterion, but several other material parameters can also influence the band bending at the contact interface. In this article, we simulate an (n)c-Si/(i)a-Si:H/p-layer interface to explore the influence of six materials parameters in a variable p-layer on the SHJ performance. We find a strong influence on the fill factor (FF) from thickness, doping, and E-VB, and on V-OC from the interfacial defect density; notably, optimal E-VB is similar to 0.1 eV higher than the valence band edge energy of a-Si:H. Multiparameter sensitivity analyses demonstrate how performance is simultaneously influenced by E-VB and doping; thus, both parameters should be optimized alongside one another. To assess the influence of these parameters experimentally, we grow p-type NiOx as a test-case p-layer, which shows that FFs decrease with the oxygen content likely from the increased misalignment of E-VB. Although modest efficiencies are achieved experimentally (>7%), what is important is that our model simulates performance trends. With these results, we apply a materials discovery pipeline to suggest new materials (e.g., ZnTe and BeTe) to try as p-layers in the SHJ. This combination of simulations, experiments, and materials discovery informs a better understanding of contact selection in SHJ cells.√≠ [Woods-Robinson, Rachel; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Woods-Robinson, Rachel; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fioretti, Angela N.; Haschke, Jan; Boccard, Mathieu; Ballif, Christophe] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Inst Microengn, Photovolta & Thin Film Elect Lab, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Fioretti, Angela N.] Intel Corp, Hillsboro, OR USA; [Haschke, Jan] REC Solar Pte Ltd, Singapore 637312, Singapore√ø  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Intel Corporation¬¥  Woods-Robinson, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Woods-Robinson, R (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.‚Äî  rachelwoodsrobinson@gmail.com; angela.fioretti@epfl.ch; jan.haschke.pv@gmail.com; mathieu.boccard@epfl.ch; kapersson@lbl.gov; christophe.ballif@epfl.ch_  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Ballif, Christophe/G-4621-2012; Haschke, Jan/H-5077-2017√´  Haschke, Jan/0000-0003-2495-9665; Fioretti, Angela N/0000-0002-3271-9023; boccard, mathieu/0000-0002-4278-3846; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Ballif, Christophe/0000-0001-8989-0545; Woods-Robinson, Rachel/0000-0001-5009-9510¬¶ Swiss National Science Foundation under Ambizione Energy under Grant ICONS [PZENP2173627]; NSF GRFP Graduate Fellowship [DGE1106400, DGE1752814]; U.C.

Embedding enzyme microparticles speeds up polyester degradation, but compromises host properties and unintentionally acceleratesthe formation of microplastics with partial polymer degradation(6,8,9). Here we showthat by nanoscopically dispersing enzymes with deep active sites, semi-crystalline polyesters can be degraded primarilyvia chain-end-mediated processive depolymerization with programmable latency and material integrity, akin to polyadenylation-induced messenger RNA decay(10). It is also feasible to achieve processivity with enzymes that have surface-exposed active sites by engineering enzyme-protectant-polymer complexes. Poly(caprolactone) and poly(lactic acid) containing less than 2 weight per cent enzymes are depolymerized in days, with up to 98 per cent polymer-to-small-molecule conversion in standard soil composts and household tap water, completely eliminating current needsto separate and landfill their products in compost facilities. Furthermore, oxidases embedded in polyolefins retain their activities. However, hydrocarbon polymers do not closely associate with enzymes, as their polyester counterparts do, and the reactive radicals that are generated cannot chemically modify the macromolecular host. This study provides molecularguidance towards enzyme-polymer pairing and the selection of enzyme protectants to modulate substrate selectivity and optimize biocatalytic pathways. The results also highlight the need for in-depth research in solid-state enzymology, especially in multi-step enzymatic cascades, to tackle chemically dormant substrates without creating secondary environmental contamination and/or biosafety concerns.√¨ [Delre, Christopher; Jiang, Yufeng; Hall, Aaron; Jayapurna, Ivan; Ruan, Zhiyuan; Ma, Le; Zolkin, Kyle; Li, Tim; Ritchie, Robert O.; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Delre, Christopher; Jiang, Yufeng; Kwon, Junpyo; Ma, Le; Ritchie, Robert O.; Russell, Thomas P.; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kang, Philjun; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kwon, Junpyo; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Scown, Corinne D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Berkeley, CA USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA¬µ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  tingxu@berkeley.edu√ñ  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; DelRe, Christopher/0000-0002-1671-5807; Li, Tim/0000-0001-8008-5881; Jayapurna, Ivan/0000-0003-1070-1014; Hall, Aaron/0000-0002-7739-201X; Ruan, Zhiyuan/0000-0001-9083-7952√é US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (DOE-BES-MSE), thr<    ough the Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites programme [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]; DOE-BES-MSE through the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids KCTR16 programme (tensiometry studies on RHP/enzyme/polymer complexation) [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Berkeley Lab; US Department of Defense, Army Research Office [W911NF-13-1-0232]; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship (Bioremediation); Bakar Fellowship at University of California Berkeley; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√Æ US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (DOE-BES-MSE), through the Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites programme(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE-BES-MSE through the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids KCTR16 programme (tensiometry studies on RHP/enzyme/polymer complexation); Berkeley Lab; US Department of Defense, Army Research Office(United States Department of Defense); National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship (Bioremediation); Bakar Fellowship at University of California Berkeley; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√∫ This work was primarily supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (DOE-BES-MSE) under contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231, through the Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104 programme (enzyme-plastic composite design and degradation mechanism; C.D., L.M., A.H., I.J., R.O.R., T.X.).

We synthesized a triblockcopolymer, poly(styrenesulfonyllithium(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide)-b-polyethylene-b-poly(styrenesulfonyllithium-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (PSLiTFSI-b-PE-b-PSLiTFSI),that self-assembles into nanophase-separated lamellae morphology.Thin membranes obtained through heat pressing this polymer were used as separators in lithium-lithium symmetric cells soaked with liquid electrolytes. Electrochemical experiments on these cells show that our ionic separator slows down salt transport from the cathodic chamber to the anodic chamber by a factor of 4 due to the well-established phenomenon of Donnan exclusion. Our work suggests that ionic separators can serve as a unique gateway to manipulate the concentration polarization, thus providing a potential solution to enable fast charging and discharging of lithium-ion batteries‚Äπ [Yu, Xiaopeng; Jiang, Xi; Seidler, Morgan E.; Shah, Neel J.; Gao, Kevin W.; Chakraborty, Saheli; Balsara, Nitash P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yu, Xiaopeng; Seidler, Morgan E.; Shah, Neel J.; Gao, Kevin W.; Chakraborty, Saheli; Balsara, Nitash P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Villaluenga, Irune] Univ Basque Country, POLYMAT Univ Basque Country, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Villaluenga, Irune] Ikerbasque, Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Balsara, Nitash P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA* United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Basque Country; POLYMAT; Basque Foundation for Science; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryR Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Balsara, NP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  Yu, Xiaopeng/AGO-7387-2022‚Ä¶  Yu, Xiaopeng/0000-0002-6617-5474; Seidler, Morgan/0000-0002-4719-8179; Shah, Neel/0000-0002-2503-048X; Gao, Kevin/0000-0002-6794-1265 Vehicle Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under the guidance of the Advanced Battery Cell Research Program; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]P Vehicle Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under the guidance of the Advanced Battery Cell Research Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)) This work was primarily supported by the Vehicle Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under the guidance of the Advanced Battery Cell Research Program (eXtreme fast charge Cell Evaluation of Lithium-ion batteries, XCEL).

Knowing the formation and assembly and actively tuning the packing of these NPSs is of significant fundamental interest for the interfacial behavior of nanoparticles and of interest for water purification, drug encapsulation, enhanced oil recovery, and innovative energy transduction applications. Here, we demonstrate by means of interfacial tension measurements the high ionic strength helps the adsorption of NPSs to the water-oil interface leading to, a denser packing of NPSs at the interface. With the reduction of interfacial area, the phase transitions from a gas-like to liquid to solid states of NPSs in two d<    imensions are observed. Finally, we provide the first in situ real-space imaging of NPSs at the water-oil interface by atomic force microcopy.g [Chai, Yu; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu; Ashby, Paul D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lukito, Alysia] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu; Jiang, Yufeng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China≈ì United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology√ü Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Ashby, PD (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.+  pdashby@lbl.gov; russell@mail.pse.umass.edu;  McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022F  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321≈Ω U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division through the user program at the Molecular Foundryq U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division through the user program at the Molecular FoundryM This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16) and through the user program at the Molecular Foundry.  OCT  10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b03462  FJ8ZP  WOS:000413057500082=  Szymanski, NJ; Zeng, Y; Huo, HY; Bartel, CJ; Kim, H; Ceder, Gd  Szymanski, Nathan J.; Zeng, Yan; Huo, Haoyan; Bartel, Christopher J.; Kim, Haegyeom; Ceder, GerbrandC  Toward autonomous design and synthesis of novel inorganic materials  MATERIALS HORIZONS√õ  HIGH-THROUGHPUT CHARACTERIZATION; THIN-FILM MATERIALS; X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; MATERIALS DISCOVERY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; COMBINATORIAL SYNTHESIS; BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION; MATERIALS LIBRARIES; POWDER DIFFRACTION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS	 Autonomous experimentation driven by artificial intelligence (AI) provides an exciting opportunity to revolutionize inorganic materials discovery and development. Herein, we review recent progress in the design of self-driving laboratories, including robotics to automate materials synthesis and characterization, in conjunction with AI to interpret experimental outcomes and propose new experimental procedures. We focus on efforts to automate inorganic synthesis through solution-based routes, solid-state reactions, and thin film deposition. In each case, connections are made to relevant work in organic chemistry, where automation is more common. Characterization techniques are primarily discussed in the context of phase identification, as this task is critical to understand what products have formed during synthesis. The application of deep learning to analyze multivariate characterization data and perform phase identification is examined. To achieve closed-loop materials synthesis and design, we further provide a detailed overview of optimization algorithms that use active learning to rationally guide experimental iterations. Finally, we highlight several key opportunities and challenges for the future development of self-driving inorganic materials synthesis platforms.5 [Szymanski, Nathan J.; Huo, Haoyan; Bartel, Christopher J.; Ceder, Gerbrand] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Szymanski, Nathan J.; Zeng, Yan; Huo, Haoyan; Bartel, Christopher J.; Kim, Haegyeom; Ceder, Gerbrand] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√§  Bartel, CJ; Ceder, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Bartel, CJ; Kim, H; Ceder, G (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.=  cbartel@berkeley.edu; haegyumkim@lbl.gov; gceder@berkeley.edu  Kim, Haegyeom/E-4448-2011¬∑  Kim, Haegyeom/0000-0002-5962-8244; Bartel, Christopher/0000-0002-5198-5036; Ceder, Gerbrand/0000-0001-9275-3605; Huo, Haoyan/0000-0003-2227-9121; Szymanski, Nathan/0000-0003-2255-9676¬ù U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCD2S2]; GENESIS EFRC program [DE-SC0019212]; Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR), an Energy Innovation Hub - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [1752814]√â U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); GENESIS EFRC program; Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR), an Energy Innovation Hub - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))‚Äì Primary funding for this work was obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the D2S2 program KCD2S2 and the GENESIS EFRC program DE-SC0019212.

Structured liquid, a new state of matter, has attracted much attention in recent years. Different with either solid or liquid, structured liquid combines the desirable characteristics of fluids with the structural stability of a solid, showing a myriad of potential applications in encapsulation, biphasic reactors, and programmable liquid constructs. Here, a brief review is given, by introducing a new strategy to structure liquids based on the formation, assembly, <    and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid-liquid interfaces. The interfacial packing of the NPSs can be effectively manipulated using external triggers, endowing the structured liquids with adaptiveness and responsiveness to changes in their external environment.b [Sun, Shuyi; Liu, Tan; Shi, Shaowei; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAu Shi, SW; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.2  shisw@mail.buct.edu.cn; Russell@mail.pse.umass.eduG US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Adaptive Inter-facial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [2194083]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51903011]Àú US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Adaptive Inter-facial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))¬ù T.P.R. was supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Inter-facial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

It was found that the smaller the lateral dimension of the GO sheets, the more rapidly the interfacial tension decreased, and the lower was the interfacial tension between the oil and water. The differences in the rates at which the interfacial tension decreased are related to the diffusion of the GO to the interface, the presentation of the GO at the interface, the degree of functionalization relative to the surface area, and the in-plane motion of the GO to accommodate the arrival of more GO at the interface to effectively cover the interface. The solidlike film formed at the interface had a modulus that increased with decreasing lateral GO dimensions.√ç [Yuan, Qingqing; Lv, Jianyong; Wang, Jianjun; Shi, Shaowei; Russell, Thomas P.; Wang, Dong] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yuan, Qingqing; Xue, Han; Lv, Jianyong; Wang, Jianjun; Shi, Shaowei] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Green Printing, Inst Chem, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Qingqing; Xue, Han; Lv, Jianyong; Wang, Jianjun; Shi, Shaowei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaJ Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Chemistry, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS‚Äì Shi, SW; Russell, TP; Wang, D (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.G  shisw@mail.buct.edu.cn; tom.p.russell@gmail.com; dwang@mail.buct.edu.cnj  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Shi, Shaowei/0000-0002-9869-4340; Wang, Dong/0000-0003-2326-0852√ê  National Natural Science Foundation of China [51673016]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]x We acknowledge the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51673016).

Stripe ordering represents an intriguing type of broken symmetry, where complex interactions result in atomic-scale lines of charge and spin density. Although phonon anomalies and periodic distortions attest the importance of electron-phonon coupling in the formation of stripe phases, a direct time-domain view of vibrational symmetry breaking is lacking. We report experiments that track the transient multi-terahertz response of the model stripe compound La1.75Sr0.25NiO4, yielding novel insight into its electronic and structural dynamics following an ultrafast optical quench. We find that although electronic carriers are immediately delocalized, the crystal symmetry remains initially frozen-as witnessed by time-delayed suppression of zone-folded Ni-O bending modes acting as a fingerprint of lattice symmetry. Longitudinal and transverse vibrations react with different speeds, indicating a strong directionality and an important role of polar interactions. The hidden complexity of electronic and structural coupling during stripe melting and formation, captured here within a single terahertz spectrum, opens new paths to understanding symmetry-breaking dynamics in solids.√å [Coslovich, Giacomo; Behl, Sascha; Huber, Bernhard; Lanzara, Alessandra; Kaindl, Robert A.] EO Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Coslovich, Giacomo] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, 2575 Sand Hill Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Kemper, Alexander F.] EO Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Computat Res Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kemper, Alexander F.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Phys, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Bechtel, Hans A.; Martin, Michael C.] EO Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sasagawa, Takao] Tokyo Inst Technol, Mat & Struct Lab, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√∏ United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Tokyo Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√Ø  Coslovich, G; Kaindl, RA (corresponding author), EO Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Coslovich, G (corresponding author), SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, 2575 Sand Hill Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.$  gcoslovich@lbl.gov; rakaindl@lbl.gov‚Ä∫  Kemper, A.

Here, the kinetics and dynamics of the crystallization of thermally evaporated Te films is visualized and modeled. Low-temperature processing of highly crystalline tellurium films with large grain size and preferred out-of-plane orientation ((100) plane parallel to the surface) is demonstrated by controlling the crystallization process. Tellurium single crystals with a lateral dimension of up to 6 mu m are realized on various substrates including glass and plastic. Field-effect transistors based on 5 degrees C crystallized Te single grains (6-nm-thick) exhibit an average effective hole mobility of approximate to 100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), and on/off current ratio of approximate to 3 x 10(4).√∂ [Zhao, Chunsong; Kim, Hyungjin; Ji, Wenbo; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Chunsong; Kim, Hyungjin; Ji, Wenbo; Chrzan, Daryl C.; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Chunsong; Batiz, Humberto; Yasar, Bengisu; Ji, Wenbo; Scott, Mary C.; Chrzan, Daryl C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Scott, Mary C.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA7 Javey, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Chrzan, DC; Javey, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Chrzan, DC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA./  dcchrzan@berkeley.edu; ajavey@eecs.berkeley.eduo  Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; Batiz Guerrero, Humberto/0000-0001-9320-013X; Sari, Bengisu/0000-0002-4421-7098: US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1201]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [HR0011-16-1-0004]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]¬° US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(United States Departme<    nt of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))g Synthesis work was supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 within the Electronic Materials Program (No. KC1201).

Through detailed fractal and percolation analyses of MG structures, derived from simulations spanning a range of compositions and quenching rates, we conclude that there is no fractal atomic-level structure associated with the packing of all atoms or solute-centered clusters. The results are in contradiction with conclusions derived from previous studies based on analyses of shifts in radial distribution function and structure factor peaks associated with volume changes induced by pressure and compositional variations. The interpretation of such shifts is shown to be challenged by the heterogeneous nature of MG structure and deformation at the atomic scale. Moreover, our analysis in the present work illustrates clearly the percolation theory applied to MGs, for example, the percolation threshold and characteristics of percolation clusters formed by subsets of atoms, which can have important consequences for structure-property relationships in these amorphous materials.√é  [Ding, Jun; Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ú  Asta, M; Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Asta, M; Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.&  mdasta@berkeley.edu; roritchie@lbl.gov4  Ritchie, Robert O/A-8066-2008; Ding, Jun/K-1989-2012D  Ritchie, Robert O/0000-0002-0501-6998; Ding, Jun/0000-0002-4091-8663> Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]j Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))k We thank Prof. Evan Ma and Drs.

Recent developments in the synthesis of polymer-grafted nanocrystals have greatly expanded the library of accessible superlattice architectures, which allows superlattice mechanical behavior to be linked to specific structural features. Here, colloidal self-assembly is used to organize polystyrene-grafted Au nanocrystals at a fluid interface to form ordered solids with sub10-nm periodic features. Thin-film buckling and nanoindentation are used to evaluate the mechanical behavior of polymer-grafted nanocrystal superlattices while exploring the role of polymer structural conformation, nanocrystal packing, and superlattice dimensions. Superlattices containing 3-20 vol % Au are found to have an elastic modulus of similar to 6-19 GPa, and hardness of similar to 120-170 MPa. We find that rapidly self-assembled superlattices have the highest elastic modulus, despite containing significant structural defects. Polymer extension, interdigitation, and grafting density are determined to be critical parameters that govern superlattice elastic and plastic deformation.¬° [Gu, X.

In this work, we utilize ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the melt properties of a representative HEA-the Cantor alloy-and its derivatives: CrMnFeCoNi, CrFeCoNi, and CrCoNi. The atomic dynamics of these melts at various temperatures are investigated, specifically to analyze their electronic and atomic structures, including charge transfer, pair distribution functions, and short-range order. Results are compared with existing information for the liquids of metallic glasses, which also typically contain multiple principal elements, but retain the amorphous state under moderate to fast cooling rates. The present results provide insights into the structural and bonding factors favoring solidification to single-phase solid solutions in HEAs.

Achieving a detailed understanding of structure-property relationships in these materials has been challenged by the compositional disorder that underlies their unique mechanical behavior. Accordingly, in this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the nature of local chemical order and establish its relationship to the intrinsic and extrinsic stacking fault energy (SFE) in CrCoNi medium-entropy solid-solution alloys, whose combination of strength, ductility, and toughness properties approaches the best on record. We find that the average intrinsic and extrinsic SFE are both highly tunable, with values ranging from -43 to 30 mJ.m(-2) and from -28 to 66 mJ.m(-2), respectively, as the degree of local chemical order increases. The state of local ordering also strongly correlates with the energy difference between the face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases, which affects the occurrence of transformation-induced plasticity. This theoretical study demonstrates that chemical short-range order is thermodynamically favored in HEAs and can be tuned to affect the mechanical behavior of these alloys. It thus addresses the pressing need to establish robust processing-structure-property relationships to guide the science-based design of new HEAs with targeted mechanical behavior.√ó  [Ding, Jun; Yu, Qin; Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAI  Ding, Jun/K-1989-2012; Ritchie, Robert O/A-8066-2008; Yu, Qin/J-9116-2019a  Ding, Jun/0000-0002-4091-8663; Ritchie, Robert O/0000-0002-0501-6998; Yu, Qin/0000-0002-5099-0327? Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory - US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]k Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory - US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)) This work was supported by the Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231.

We have designed, built, and deployed porous absorbers for capturing chemotherapy drugs from the bloodstream after these drugs have had their effect on a tumor, but before they are released into the body where they can cause hazardous side effects. The support structure of the absorbers was built using 3D printing technology. This structure was coated with a nanostructured block copolymer with outer blocks that anchor the polymer chains to the 3D printed support structure and a middle block that has an affinity for the drug. The middle block is polystyrenesulfonate which binds to doxorubicin, a widely used and effective chemotherapy drug with significant toxic side effects. The absorbers are designed for deployment during chemotherapy using minimally invasive image-guided endovascular surgical procedures. We show that the introduction of the absorbers into the blood of swine models enables the capture of 64 +/- 6% of the administered drug (doxorubicin) without any immediate adverse effects. Problems related to blood clots, vein wall dissection, and other biocompatibility issues were not observed. This development represents a significant step forward in minimizing toxic side effects of chemotherapy.

This study for the first time opens a pathway for the construction of multiresponsive, structured all-liquid systems by introducing host-guest chemistry, showing promising potential applications in encapsulation, delivery systems, and unique microfluidic devices.Z [Sun, Huilou; Li, Lianshun; Russell, Thomas P.; Shi, Shaowei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn Be, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAh Russell, TP; Shi, SW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn Be, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.√æ  Beijing Natural Science Foundation [2194083]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51903011]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]O Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))≈∏ This work was supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2194083) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51903011).

In the absence of electron-electron interactions, they are calculable with standard perturbation theory starting from the band structure of Bloch electrons, but the resulting formulas are often large and unwieldy, involving many energy denominators from intermediate states. This work gives a Feynman diagram approach to calculating nonlinear responses. This diagrammatic method is a systematic way to perform perturbation theory, which often offers shorter derivations and also provides a natural interpretation of nonlinear responses in terms of physical processes. Applying this method to second-order responses concisely reproduces formulas for the second-order-harmonic shift current. We then apply this method to third-order responses and derive formulas for third-order-harmonic generation and self-focusing of light, which can be directly applied to tight-binding models. Third-order responses in the semiclasscial regime include a Berry curvature quadrupole term, whose importance is discussed including symmetry considerations and when the Berry curvature quadrupole becomes the leading contribution. The method is applied to compute third-order optical responses for a model Weyl semimetal, where we find a new topological contribution that diverges in a clean material, as well as resonances with a peculiar linear character.√∫  [Parker, Daniel E.; Morimoto, Takahiro; Orenstein, Joseph; Moore, Joel E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Morimoto, Takahiro; Orenstein, Joseph; Moore, Joel E.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAZ  Parker, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.]  daniel_parker@berkeley.edu; tmorimoto@berkeley.edu; jworenstein@lbl.gov; jemoore@berkeley.edu  Morimoto, Takahiro/L-9826-2018M  Morimoto, Takahiro/0000-0003-4825-7377; Orenstein, Joseph/0000-0003-3741-67072 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC2202]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundations EPiQS Initiative Theory Center; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundations EPiQS Initiative [GBMF4537]; NSF GRFP [DGE 1752814]j U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundations EPiQS Initiative Theory Center; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundations EPiQS Initiative; NSF GRFP(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD))\ The authors thank Adolfo Grushin, Daniel Passos, and Jonah Haber for useful discussions.

This not only hinders the experimental realization of novel materials but also complicates the interpretation and understanding of solid-state reaction mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate a machine-learning approach that predicts synthesis conditions using large solid-state synthesis data sets text-mined from scientific journal articles. Using feature importance ranking analysis, we discovered that optimal heating temperatures have strong correlations with the stability of precursor materials quantified using melting points and formation energies (& UDelta;Gf, & UDelta;Hf). In contrast, features derived from the thermodynamics of synthesis-related reactions did not directly correlate to the chosen heating temperatures. This correlation between optimal solid-state heating temperature and precursor stability extends Tamman's rule from intermetallics to oxide systems, suggesting the importance of reaction kinetics in determining synthesis conditions. Heating times are shown to be strongly correlated with the chosen experimental procedures and instrument setups, which may be indicative of human bias in the data set. Using these predictive features, we constructed machine-learning models with good performance and general applicability to predict the conditions required to synthesize diverse chemical systems. [Huo, Haoyan; Bartel, Christopher J.; He, Tanjin; Dunn, Alexander; Ouyang, Bin; Ceder, Gerbrand] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huo, Haoyan; Bartel, Christopher J.; He, Tanjin; Trewartha, Amalie; Ouyang, Bin; Ceder, Gerbrand] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Trewartha, Amalie] Toyota Res Inst, 4440 El Camino Real, Los Altos, CA 94022 USA; [Dunn, Alexander; Jain, Anubhav] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√æ  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Toyota Motor Corporation<    ; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory√Ñ  Ceder, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Ceder, G (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  gceder@berkeley.edu≈Ω  Ouyang, Bin/0000-0002-8181-6815; Huo, Haoyan/0000-0003-2227-9121; Bartel, Christopher/0000-0002-5198-5036; Ceder, Gerbrand/0000-0001-9275-3605 National Science Foundation under DMREF [DMR-1922372]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCD2S2]; Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy¬¨ National Science Foundation under DMREF(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))	 The authors thank Dr. Olga Kononova for useful discussions on the solid-state synthesis dataset.

However, the current informatics infrastructure has yet to unlock the full knowledge available within existing datasets or to explore connections between different materials science domains. Here, we present a streamlined system for codifying and connecting materials properties in an open-source Python framework: propnet. We demonstrate the capability of this framework to augment existing datasets of materials properties: by consecutively applying a network of physical relationships to calculate related information, propnet connects disparate domain knowledge. Beyond an immediate increase in available information, the results allow for the examination of correlations between sets of properties and guide the design of multifunctional materials. By emphasizing code extensibility and simplicity, we offer this software to the materials science community for general application to any experimental or computationally derived materials database.‚Äπ [Mrdjenovich, David; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 210 Hearst Min Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Horton, Matthew K.; Legaspi, Christian M.; Dwaraknath, Shyam; Tshitoyan, Vahe; Jain, Anubhav; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Montoya, Joseph H.] Toyota Res Inst, 4440 EL Camino Real, Los Altos, CA 94022 USA¬≠  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Toyota Motor Corporation√¢  Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 210 Hearst Min Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.‚Ñ¢  Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Jain, Anubhav/0000-0001-5893-9967; Dwaraknath, Shyam/0000-0003-0289-2607; Legaspi, Christian/0000-0002-5700-8586¬Æ  Toyota Research Institute; Materials Project Program through the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division [KC23MP, DE-AC02-05CH11231]¬º  Toyota Research Institute; Materials Project Program through the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))\ We acknowledge the Toyota Research Institute for funding the development of this public codebase.

In particular, exhaustive knowledge of solvation structure, stability, and transport properties is critical for developing stable electrolytes for fast-charging and high-energy-density next-generation energy storage systems. Accordingly, there is growing interest in the rational design of electrolytes for beyond lithium-ion systems by tuning the molecular-level interactions of solvate species present in the electrolytes. Here we present a review of the solvation structure of multivalent electrolytes and its impact on the electrochemical performance of these batteries. A direct correlation between solvate species present in the solution and macroscopic properties of electrolytes is sparse for multivalent electrolytes and contradictory results have been reported in the literature. This review aims to illustrate the current understanding, compare results, and highlight future needs and directions to enable the deep understanding needed for the rational design of improved multivalent electrolytes.√å [Rajput, Nav Nidhi; Seguin, Trevor J.; Wood, Brandon M.; Qu, Xiaohui; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Qu, Xiaohui; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wood, Brandon M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rajput, Nav Nidhi; Seguin, Trevor J.; Wood, Brandon M.; Persson, Kristin A.] Joint Ctr Energy Storage Res, Chicago, IL USA Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Joint Ctr Energy Storage Res, Chicago, IL USA.√ö  Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR), an Energy Innovation Hub - U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) [DEAC02-06CH11357]; BES DOE Grant [KC23MP, DE-AC02-05CH11231]√ï  Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR), an Energy Innovation Hub - U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); BES DOE Grant	 Funding for meeting the cost of this review article was supported by the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR), an Energy Innovation Hub funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES), under Contract No. DEAC02-06CH11357.

The packing density of CNCSs at the interface can be adjusted by tuning parameters such as pH, ionic strength, and concentration/molecular weight of the end-functionalized polymer ligands. Stable non-spherical emulsions are obtained during homogenization, as a result of the interfacial jamming of CNCSs, with pH-triggered reconfigurability. Porous materials are prepared by freeze-drying creamed, CNCS-stabilized emulsions. The cells of the porous materials have a controlled pore size and shape that are commensurate with the droplets in the emulsion and are responsive to pH. The behavior of the adaptive, reconfigurable supracolloidal system is coupled to its internal and surrounding environment.¬Ø [Li, Yanan; Liu, Xubo; Shi, Shaowei; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Dong] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhen] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo Inst Nanotechnol, Dept Chem Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Zhao, Shaojie; Tian, Guifang; Zheng, Jinkai] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Food Sci & Technol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China^ Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of Waterloo; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Food Science & Technology, CAASu Shi, SW; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.v  Zheng, Jinkai/AAE-3321-2021; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; Zhao, Shaojie/AAZ-5143-2021; Shi, Shaowei/X-3692-2019m  Zheng, Jinkai/0000-0002-8166-0048; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Shi, Shaowei/0000-0002-9869-4340 The U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16) is acknowledged.	  1433-7851	  1521-3773  ANGEW CHEM INT EDIT  Angew.

Herein, we show that rod-like cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)-based NP-surfactants, termed CNC-surfactants, are formed rapidly at the liquid/liquid interface, assemble into a monolayer, and, when jammed, offer a robust assembly with exceptional mechanical properties. Plateau-Rayleigh (PR) instabilities of a free-falling jet of an aqueous medium containing the CNCs into a toluene solution of amine end-functionalized polystyrene are completely suppressed, allowing the jetting of aqueous tubules that are stabilized when the CNC-surfactants are jammed at the interface.

Herein, in situ TEM at temperatures from 20 to 800 degrees C was conducted to study the thermal-induced structural changes in C-S-H. We captured C-S-H shrinks at an average rate of 0.02 mu m(2)/degrees C upon heating with three stages observed, including induction, constant, and rapid periods. Our observation revealed that an 800 nm pore could be healed during pore structure evolution owing to the reconstruction and deformation among C-S-H blocks. The Ca/Si ratio was dropped at higher temperatures because of the leakage of calcium ions from the C-S-H structure to form CaO precipitates. The temperature-driven phase transformation and degradation were also detected using electron diffraction that C-S-H was transformed into metastable calcium silicate minerals above 800 degrees C. This work provides insights into the nanoscale transformation of C-S-H at high temperatures.¬∏ [Zheng, Qi; Jiang, Jinyang] Southeast Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Qi; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Xinle] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustillo, Karen C.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA USA; [Li, Xinle] Clark Atlanta Univ, Dept Chem, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA) Southeast University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Clark Atlanta University√â  Jiang, JY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.'  jiangjinyang16@163.com; hmzheng@lbl.gov¬™ U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Science and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1706222, 51925903]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC0705401]√§ U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Science and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China√Ç H.

The surface tension of the oil-water interface was found to depend strongly on the choice of the polymer surfactant used to assemble the NPSs, with polymer surfactants bearing multiple polar groups being the most effective at reducing interfacial tension and driving the NPS assembly. By contrast, only small variations in the shear modulus of the system were observed, suggesting that it is determined largely by particle density. In the presence of polymer surfactants bearing multiple functional grou<    ps, NPS assemblies on pendant drop surfaces were observed to spontaneously solidify above a critical polymer surfactant concentration. Interfacial solidification accelerated rapidly as polymer surfactant concentration was increased. On long timescales after solidification, pendant drop interfaces were observed to spontaneously wrinkle at sufficiently low surface tensions (approximately 5 mN m(-1)). Interfacial shear rheology of the NPS assemblies was elastic-dominated, with the shear modulus ranging from 0.1 to 1 N m(-1), comparable to values obtained for nanoparticle monolayers elsewhere. Our work paves the way for the development of designer, multicomponent oil-water interfaces with well-defined mechanical, structural, and functional properties.√ß [Toor, Anju] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, 6141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Toor, Anju; Forth, Joe; Jiang, Yufeng; Liu, Xubo; Chai, Yu; Hou, Honghao; Ashby, Paul D.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [de Araujo, Simone Bochner; Merola, Maria Consiglia; Fuller, Gerald G.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 443 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jiang, Yufeng; Chai, Yu] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Xubo; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Chai, Yu; Ashby, Paul D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan√Ñ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Tohoku University Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.  russell@mail.pse.umass.eduX  Toor, Anju/AAP-4939-2021; Hou, Honghao/HKN-1747-2023; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022√ç  Hou, Honghao/0000-0002-7133-9760; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Fuller, Gerald/0000-0002-2924-053X; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321; Forth, Joe/0000-0001-7263-6364; Ashby, Paul/0000-0003-4195-310X√Ä  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program [DE-ACO2-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Molecular Foundry√ç  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Molecular Foundry= This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under contract no.

Despite the advantages afforded by NMR in structural characterization, the relationship between. and local structure of an atom in high-symmetry environments, such as Si-Q4 sites, is poorly understood. Here, we use a data-driven approach combining random forest feature ranking and the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) approach to derive a simple and accurate geometric descriptor for zeta with a root-meansquared prediction error of 6.77 ppm and an R-2 of 0.761. We then apply this descriptor to describe the local geometric distortion of zeolites Sigma-2 and silica-ZSM-5 whose chemical shift anisotropy tensor has been reported. We envision that this geometric descriptor will allow for structural description and refinement in previously difficult-to-describe materials. [Venetos, Maxwell C.; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dwaraknath, Shyam] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√§  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryt  Venetos, Maxwell/0000-0003-3468-2006; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Dwaraknath, Shyam/0000-0003-0289-2607√ç  U.S. National Science Foundation [DIBBS OAC 1640899]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]√©  U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)) The author thanks Dr. Philip Grandinetti and Dr. Deepansh Srivastava for helpful discussions.

Interfacial assemblies of colloids, however, can be used to shape liquids into complex, 3D objects, simultaneously forming 2D layers with novel magnetic, plasmonic, or structural properties. Fully exploiting all-liquid systems that are structured by their interfaces would create a new class of biomimetic, reconfigurable, and responsive materials. Here, printed constructs of water in oil are presented. Both form and function are given to the system by the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants, formed from the interfacial interaction of nanoparticles and amphiphilic polymers that bear complementary functional groups. These yield dissipative constructs that exhibit a compartmentalized response to chemical cues. Potential applications<     include biphasic reaction vessels, liquid electronics, novel media for the encapsulation of cells and active matter, and dynamic constructs that both alter, and are altered by, their external environment.‚Äò [Forth, Joe; Hasnain, Jaffar; Toor, Anju; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Xubo; Shi, Shaowei; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Hasnain, Jaffar; Geissler, Phillip L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Toor, Anju] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miszta, Karol; Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Geissler, Phillip L.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Chem Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Emrick, Todd; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Tohoku University Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.o  McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Toor, Anju/AAP-4939-2021; Shi, Shaowei/X-3692-2019; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022H  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Forth, Joe/0000-0001-7263-6364 This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).  10.1002/adma.201707603  GD4FX  WOS:000430460100028=  Latimer, K; Dwaraknath, S; Mathew, K; Winston, D; Persson, KAZ  Latimer, Katherine; Dwaraknath, Shyam; Mathew, Kiran; Winston, Donald; Persson, Kristin A.f  Evaluation of thermodynamic equations of state across chemistry and structure in the materials project  NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS!  OF-STATE; COMPRESSIBILITY; STRAINÀú Thermodynamic equations of state (EOS) for crystalline solids describe material behaviors under changes in pressure, volume, entropy and temperature, making them fundamental to scientific research in a wide range of fields including geophysics, energy storage and development of novel materials. Despite over a century of theoretical development and experimental testing of energy-volume (E-V) EOS for solids, there is still a lack of consensus with regard to which equation is indeed optimal, as well as to what metric is most appropriate for making this judgment. In this study, several metrics were used to evaluate quality of fit for 8 different EOS across 87 elements and over 100 compounds which appear in the literature. Our findings do not indicate a clear best EOS, but we identify three which consistently perform well relative to the rest of the set. Furthermore, we find that for the aggregate data set, the RMSrD is not strongly correlated with the nature of the compound, e.g., whether it is a metal, insulator, or semiconductor, nor the bulk modulus for any of the EOS, indicating that a single equation can be used across a broad range of classes of materials.E [Latimer, Katherine] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dwaraknath, Shyam; Winston, Donald; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mathew, Kiran; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√¢  Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.D  Winston, Donald/AAD-1191-2022; Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020%  Winston, Donald/0000-0002-8424-0604;   U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-AC36-089028308]; Department of Energy (DOE) Basic Energy Sciences (BES) Materials Project program [KC23MP]; Anselm MP&S Fund through the UC Berkeley Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship programD U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Department of Energy (DOE) Basic Energy Sciences (BES) Materials Project program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Anselm MP&S Fund through the UC Berkeley Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program Intellectually led by the Center for Next Generation Materials by Design, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under Awards DE-AC02-05CH11231 and DE-AC36-089028308.

Spatially directing functionality within them and coupling processes in both phases remains a challenge. Here, we exploit nanoclay-polymer surfactant assemblies at an oil-water interface to produce a semi-permeable membrane between the liquids, and from them all-liquid fluidic devices with bespoke properties. Flow channels are fabricated using micropatterned 2D substrates and liquid-in-liquid 3D printing. The anionic walls of the device can be functionalized with cationic small molecules, enzymes, and colloidal nanocrystal catalysts. Multi-step chemical transformations can be conducted within the channels under flow, as can selective mass transport across the liquid-liquid interface for in-line separations. These all-liquid systems become automated using pumps, detectors, and control systems, revealing a latent ability for chemical logic and learning.√í [Feng, Wenqian; Forth, Joe; Ashby, Paul D.; Russell, Thomas P.; Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu; Ashby, Paul D.; Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thom<    as P.] Tohoku Univ, WPI, AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japank United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Tohoku University√•  Helms, BA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Helms, BA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  bahelms@lbl.gov√å  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321; Feng, Wenqian/0000-0003-3561-5593; Forth, Joe/0000-0001-7263-6364; Helms, Brett/0000-0003-3925-4174; Ashby, Paul/0000-0003-4195-310XO U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KCTR16]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]s U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))" This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

To accelerate the discovery and design of such materials, we develop a general, chemically, and structurally agnostic methodology for identifying the optimal Li sites in any crystalline material. For a given crystal structure, we attempt multiple Li insertions at symmetrically in-equivalent positions by analyzing the electronic charge density obtained from first-principles density functional theory. In this report, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure in successfully identifying the positions of the Li ion in well-known cathode materials using only the empty host (charged) material as guidance.

In particular, there has been a surge to identify lead-free piezoelectric materials to replace PbZr0.52Ti0.48OSr2Nb2O7. This study examines a computational strategy to identify increased piezoelectric and dielectric responses of alloy systems based on the linear interpolation of force constants, Born effective charges, and internal strain tensors from their end-point compounds. We choose the ferroelectric layered perovskite Sr2Nb2O7 as a parent structure and employ this alloying strategy for 19 potential cation substitutions, targeting thermodynamically metastable alloys with high piezoelectric response. From this screening, we identify Sr2Nb2-2xV2xO7 as a promising polar system. We conduct large-unit-cell calculations of Sr2Nb2-2xV2xO7 at x = 0.0625, 0.125 for multiple cation orderings and find a significant 184% enhanced piezoelectric response. The solid solution system is synthesized as single-crystalline thin-film heterostructures using pulsed-laser deposition, and an enhanced dielectric response is observed at x = 0.05 and at x = 0.1.

In these phenomena, the governing process is the EP relaxation into the ground states upon excitation, where various mechanisms are extensively investigated with thermodynamic limits. However, the relaxation process becomes drastically different and could significantly advance the understanding of EP dynamics for these quantum phenomena, when excited states of EPs are involved. Here, for the first time, we observe nonlinear optical responses at the EP excited states in a monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) microcavity, including dark excited states and dynamically metastable upper polariton bands. The nonlinear optics leads to unique emissions of ground states with prominent valley degree of freedom (DOF) via an anomalous relaxation process, which is applicable to a wide range of semiconductors from monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to emerging halide perov√Ω√ø√ø√ø‚Äö  ∆í  ‚Äû  ‚Ä¶  ‚Ä†  ‚Ä°  ÀÜ  ‚Ä∞  ≈†  ‚Äπ  ≈í  ¬ç  ≈Ω  ¬è  ¬ê  ‚Äò  ‚Äô  ‚Äú  ‚Äù  ‚Ä¢  ‚Äì  ‚Äî  Àú  ‚Ñ¢  ≈°  ‚Ä∫  ≈ì  ¬ù  ≈æ  ≈∏  ¬†  ¬°  ¬¢  ¬£  ¬§  ¬•  ¬¶  ¬ß  ¬®  ¬©  ¬™  ¬´  ¬¨  ¬≠  ¬Æ  ¬Ø  ¬∞  ¬±  ¬≤  ¬≥  ¬¥  ¬µ  ¬∂  ¬∑  ¬∏  ¬π  ¬∫  ¬ª  ¬º  ¬Ω  ¬æ  ¬ø  √Ä  √Å  √Ç  √É  √Ñ  √Ö  √Ü  √á  √à  √â  √ä  √ã  √å  √ç  √é  √è  √ê  √ë  √í  √ì  √î  √ï  √ñ  √ó  √ò  √ô  √ö  √õ  √ú  √ù  √û  √ü  √†  √°  √¢  √£  √§  √•  √¶  √ß  √®  √©  √™  √´  √¨  √≠  √Æ  √Ø  √∞  √±  √≤  √≥  √¥  √µ  √∂  √∑  √∏  √π  √∫  √ª  √º  √Ω  √æ  √ø    skites.

Algorithms to determine coordination numbers automatically are increasingly used for machine learning (ML) and automatic structural analysis. In this work, we introduce MaterialsCoord, a benchmark suite containing 56 experimentally derived crystal structures (spanning elements, binaries, and ternary compounds) and their corresponding coordination environments as described in the research literature. We also describe CrystalNN, a novel algorithm for determining near neighbors. We compare CrystalNN against seven existing near-neighbor algorithms on the MaterialsCoord benchmark, finding CrystalNN to perform similarly to several well-established algorithms. For each algorithm, we also assess computational demand and sensitivity toward small perturbations that mimic thermal motion. Finally, we investigate the similarity between bonding algorithms when applied to the Materials Project database. We expect that this work will aid the development of coordination prediction algorithms as well as improve structural descriptors for ML and other applications.\ [Pan, Hillary; Ganose, Alex M.; Horton, Matthew; Aykol, Muratahan; Zimmermann, Nils E.

Here we present a Python-based Corvus workflow for simulations of full spectrum optical constants from the visible and ultraviolet to hard x-ray wavelengths based on the real-space Green's function code FEFF10 and structural data from the Materials Project (MP). The Corvus workflow manager and its associated tools provide an interface to FEFF10 and the MP database. The workflow parallelizes the FEFF computations of optical constants over all absorption edges for each material in the MP database specified by a unique MP-ID. The workflow tools determine the distribution of computational resources needed for that case. Similarly, the optical constants for selected sets of materials can be computed in a single-shot. To illustrate the approach, we present results for several elemental solids in the periodic table, as well as a sample compound, and compare our predictions with experimental results. In addition, we provide a database of calculated results for all elements for which there is a stable elemental solid at standard conditions available in the Materials Project database. As in x-ray absorption spectra, these results are interpreted in terms of an atomic-like background and fine-structure contributions.¬® [Kas, J. J.; Vila, F. D.; Rehr, J.

Here, we study the effects of this compositional heterogeneity in HEAs on their mechanical properties using in situ compression testing in the transmission electron microscope (TEM), combined with molecular dynamics simulations. We report an anomalous size effect on the yield strength in HEAs, arising from such compositional heterogeneity. By progressively reducing the sample size, HEAs initially display the classical smaller-is-stronger phenomenon, similar to pure metals and conventional alloys. However, as the sample size is decreased below a critical characteristic length (similar to 180 nm), influenced by the size-scale of compositional heterogeneity, a transition from homogeneous deformation to a heterogeneous distribution of planar slip is observed, coupled with an anomalous smaller-is-weaker size effect. Atomic-scale computational modeling shows these observations arise due to compositional fluctuations over a few nanometers. These results demonstrate the efficacy of influencing mechanical properties in HEAs through control of local compositional variations at the nanoscale.{ [Yan, Jingyuan; Yu, Qian] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Electron Microscopy, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jingyuan; Yu, Qian] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Yin, Sheng; Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab Berkeley, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ding, Jun] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Ctr Alloy Innovat & Design CAID, State Key Lab Mech Behav Mat, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jingyuan] Univ Tokyo, Inst Engn Innovat, Tokyo 1138656, Japan√≠  Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Xi'an Jiaotong University; University of Tokyoy Yu, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Electron Microscopy, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.;Yu, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.;Ding, J (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Ctr Alloy Innovat & Design CAID, State Key Lab Mech Behav Mat, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.&  dingsn@xjtu.edu.cn; yu_qian@zju.edu.cn  Ding, Jun/K-1989-2012=  Ding, Jun/0000-0002-4091-8663; Asta, Mark/0000-0002-8968-321Xb National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0208200]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [12004294]; National Youth Talents Program; HPC platform of Xi'an Jiaotong University [KC13]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231]≈† National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Youth Talents Program; HPC platform of Xi'an Jiaotong University; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬∫ Q.Y. was funded by National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant numbers 2017YFA0208200], National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 51671168] and [grant numbers 51871197].

However, high-quality bP can be obtained only via mechanical exfoliation from high-temperature- and high-pressure-grown bulk crystals and degrades rapidly when exposed to ambient conditions. Here, we report solution-synthesized and air-stable quasi-2D tellurium (Te) nanoflakes for short-wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors. We perform comprehensive optical <    characterization via polarization-resolved transmission and reflection measurements and report the absorbance and complex refractive index of Te crystals. It is found that this material is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 0.31 eV. From temperature dependent electrical measurements, we confirm this band-gap value and find that 12 nm thick Te nanoflakes show high hole mobilities of 450 and 1430 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 300 and 77 K, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that despite its indirect band gap, Te can be utilized for high-performance SWIR photodetectors by employing optical cavity substrates consisting of Au/Al2O3 to dramatically increase the absorption in the semiconductor. By changing the thickness of the Al2O3 cavity, the peak responsivity of Te photoconductors can be tuned from 1.4 mu m (13 A/W) to 2.4 mu m (8 A/W) with a cutoff wavelength of 3.4 fully capturing the SWIR band. An optimized room-temperature specific detectivity (D*) of 2 X 10(9) cm Hz(1/2) W-1 is obtained at a wavelength of 1.7 mu m.√± [Amani, Matin; Tan, Chaoliang; Zhang, George; Zhao, Chunsong; Bullock, James; Kim, Hyungjin; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Amani, Matin; Tan, Chaoliang; Zhang, George; Zhao, Chunsong; Bullock, James; Kim, Hyungjin; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Chunsong; Song, Xiaohui; Scott, Mary] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Song, Xiaohui; Scott, Mary] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shrestha, Vivek Raj; Crozier, Kenneth B.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Phys, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Gao, Yang; Crozier, Kenneth B.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3010, AustraliaZ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne¬¢  Song, Xiaohui/AAU-6080-2020; Tan, Chaoliang/T-3036-2017; Bullock, James/T-8182-2018; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013; CROZIER, KENNETH/J-7143-2016¬Ø  Song, Xiaohui/0000-0003-2523-2556; Tan, Chaoliang/0000-0003-1695-5285; Bullock, James/0000-0001-7903-9642; Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; CROZIER, KENNETH/0000-0003-0947-001Xf Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [HR0011-16-1-0004]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Electronic Materials Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1201]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√ç Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Electronic Materials Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))- Device fabrication and measurements were supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under contract no.

Systematic discovery of functional 2D materials has been the focus of many studies. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D materials, with more than 6,000 monolayer structures, obtained from both top-down and bottom-up discovery procedures. First, we screened all bulk materials in the database of Materials Project for layered structures by a topology-based algorithm and theoretically exfoliated them into monolayers. Then, we generated new 2D materials by chemical substitution of elements in known 2D materials by others from the same group in the periodic table. The structural, electronic and energetic properties of these 2D materials are consistently calculated, to provide a starting point for further material screening, data mining, data analysis and artificial intelligence applications.

It is a crucial parameter in spectroscopy as well as materials design, especially for technologies such as thermionic electron guns and Schottky barriers. In this work, we present the largest database of calculated work functions for elemental crystals to date. This database contains the anisotropic work functions of more than 100 polymorphs of about 72 elements and up to a maximum Miller index of two and three for non-cubic and cubic crystals, respectively. The database has been rigorously validated against previous experimental and computational data where available. We also propose a weighted work function based on the Wulff shape that can be compared to measurements from polycrystalline specimens, and show that this weighted work function can be modeled empirically using simple atomic parameters. Furthermore, for the first time, we were able to analyze simple bond breaking rules for metallic systems beyond a maximum Miller index of one, allowing for a more generalized investigation of work function anisotropy.v [Tran, Richard; Li, Xiang-Guo; Ong, Shyue Ping] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept NanoEngn, 9500 Gilman Dr,Mail Code 0448, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Montoya, Joseph H.; Winston, Donald; Persson, Kristin Aslaug] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Environm Energy Technol Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin Aslaug] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ò  University of California System; University of California San Diego; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley{  Ong, SP (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept NanoEngn, 9500 Gilman Dr,Mail Code 0448, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.  ongsp@eng.ucsd.edu  Winston, Donald/AAD-1191-2022; Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Ong, Shyue Ping/AAY-1642-2021; Li, Xiangguo/ABE-2798-2020J  Winston, Donald/0000-0002-8424-0604; Ong, Shyue Ping/0000-0001-5726-2587; √ñ  Materials Project - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]; National Science Foundation [ACI-1053575]√∏  Materials Project - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))b This work is supported by the Materials Project, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract no.

The ability to generate long-lived potentials on these surfaces provides opportunities to manipulate the spin-momentum locked topological surface states. Moreover, the photo-induced nature of this effect allows for localized excitation of arbitrary geometries. Knowing precisely how these potentials form and evolve is critical in understanding how to manage the effect in applications. The uniqueness of the photoemission experimental geometry, in which the photoelectron must traverse the induced surface field in vacuum, provides an interesting probe of the electric dipole shape generated by the surface photovoltage. In this study, we are able to match the observed decay of the geometric effect on the photoelectron to an essential electrodynamics model of the light-induced dipole thereby tracking the fluence-dependent evolution of the dipole geometry. By utilizing a standard time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission experiment, we are able to determine real-space information of the dipole while simultaneously recovering time-resolved band structure.√ï  [Ciocys, S.; Morimoto, T.; Moore, J.

To identify structural families with similar resilience, we develop a first-principles sensitivity analysis approach to determine the effect of disorder on the piezoelectric response for <    structures in the Materials Project database. In well-known piezoelectric systems, the lattice dynamics, rather than internal strain or dielectric, control the polar response. Additionally, multiple stable optical phonon modes are found to contribute to the piezoelectric response, providing a fingerprint for disorder tolerance. A multiple-phonon mode criterion is used to evaluate candidate materials for disorder-tolerant piezoelectric prototype systems. Five promising structures are altered through chemical substitution, generating potential MPB end points with large piezoelectric responses beyond perovskites including Akermanite Sr2xCa2-2xCoSi2O7, which exhibits a nearly 20% increase in response at the 50% composition.√ú  [Ling, Handong; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; [Dwaraknath, Shyam S.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAe  Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.N  Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Dwaraknath, Shyam/0000-0003-0289-2607w Center for Next Generation Materials by Design, an Energy Frontier Research Center - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]; Office of Science of the DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]¬∞ Center for Next Generation Materials by Design, an Energy Frontier Research Center - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√º This work was primarily supported by the Center for Next Generation Materials by Design, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under Award DE-AC02-05CH11231.

This simple process, where the viscosity of the CNC dispersion can range from that of water to a crosslinked gel, opens tremendous opportunities for encapsulation, delivery systems, and unique microfluidic devices. The process described is generally applicable to any functionalized nanoparticles dispersed in one liquid and polymer ligands having complementary functionality dissolved in a second immiscible liquid. Such sculpted liquids retain all the characteristics of the liquids but retain shape indefinitely, very much like a solid, and provide a new platform for next-generation soft materials.√´ [Shi, Shaowei; Liu, Xubo; Li, Yanan; Wu, Xuefei; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dong] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Forth, Joe; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA√Æ  Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst√π Shi, SW; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Wang, D (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.U  McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Shi, Shaowei/X-3692-2019; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022j  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Forth, Joe/0000-0001-7263-6364; Shi, Shaowei/0000-0002-9869-4340d U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering at the Beijing University of Chemical TechnologyG U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program; Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering at the Beijing University of Chemical Technology√∂ S.S. and X.L. contributed equally to this work.

Janus-like DNA surfactants (DNASs) assemble in situ at the interface, forming an elastic film. By controlling the jamming and unjamming behavior of DNASs, the interfacial assemblies can assume three different physical states: solid-like, elastomer-like, and liquid-like, similar to that seen with thermoplastics upon heating, that change from a glassy to a rubbery state, and then to a viscous liquid. By the interfacial jamming of DNASs, the liquid structures can be locked-in and reconfigured, showing promising potentials for drug delivery, biphasic reactors, and programmable liquid constructs.√Ä [Qian, Bingqing; Shi, Shaowei; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv <    Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haiqiao] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√Æ  Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory‚Äπ  Shi, SW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.  shisw@mail.buct.edu.cn√æ  National Natural Science Foundation of China [51903011]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [2194083]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]O National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬ù This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51903011) and Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2194083).

  TRANSITION√Æ Two-dimensional (2D) noble-metal dichalcogenides exhibit exceptionally strong thickness-dependent bandgaps, which can be leveraged in a wide variety of device applications. A detailed study of their optical (e.g., optical bandgaps) and electrical properties (e.g., mobilities) is important in determining potential future applications of these materials. In this work, we perform detailed optical and electrical characterization of 2D PdSe2 nanoflakes mechanically exfoliated from a single-crystalline source. Layer-dependent bandgap analysis from optical absorption results indicates that this material is an indirect semiconductor with bandgaps of approximately 1.37 and 0.50eV for the monolayer and bulk, respectively. Spectral photoresponse measurements further confirm these bandgap values. Moreover, temperature-dependent electrical measurements of a 6.8-nm-thick PdSe2 flake-based transistor show effective electron mobilities of 130 and 520cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) at 300K and 77K, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that PdSe2 can be utilized for short-wave infrared photodetectors. A room-temperature specific detectivity (D-*) of 1.8x10(10)cm Hz(1/2) W-1 at 1 mu m with a band edge at 1.94 mu m is achieved on a 6.8-nm-thick PdSe2 flake-based photodetector. [Zhang, George; Amani, Matin; Tan, Chaoliang; Bullock, James; Kim, Hyungjin; Lien, Der-Hsien; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, George; Amani, Matin; Tan, Chaoliang; Bullock, James; Kim, Hyungjin; Lien, Der-Hsien; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chaturvedi, Apoorva; Zhang, Hua] Nanyang Technol Univ, Ctr Programmable Mat, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Block N4-1,50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Song, Xiaohui; Scott, Mary C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Song, Xiaohui; Scott, Mary C.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Hua] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Chem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China¬º University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; City University of Hong Kong√Ö  Lien, Der-Hsien/GYD-6547-2022; Zhang, Hua/A-1302-2009; Chaturvedi, Apoorva/ABE-4159-2020; Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013; Song, Xiaohui/AAU-6080-2020; Tan, Chaoliang/T-3036-2017; Bullock, James/T-8182-2018√∑  Lien, Der-Hsien/0000-0001-6774-2074; Zhang, Hua/0000-0001-9518-740X; Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; Song, Xiaohui/0000-0003-2523-2556; Tan, Chaoliang/0000-0003-1695-5285; Bullock, James/0000-0001-7903-9642; Chaturvedi, Apoorva/0000-0002-6606-0706√£ Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [HR0011-16-1-0004]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Electronic Materials Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1201]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; ITC via the Hong Kong Branch of National Precious Metals Material Engineering Research Center; City University of Hong Kongh Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Electronic Materials Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); ITC via the Hong Kong Branch of National Precious Metals Material Engineering Research Center; City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong)√© Device fabrication and measurements were supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract No. HR0011-16-1-0004.

However, these materials require complex growth and device fabrication procedures. Here, thermally evaporated Se(x)Te(1-)(x)alloy thin films with tunable bandgaps for the fabrication of high-performan<    ce SWIR photodetectors are reported. From absorption measurements, it is shown that the bandgaps of Se(x)Te(1-)(x)films can be tuned continuously from 0.31 eV (Te) to 1.87 eV (Se). Owing to their tunable bandgaps, the peak responsivity position and photoresponse edge of Se(x)Te(1-)(x)film-based photoconductors can be tuned in the SWIR regime. By using an optical cavity substrate consisting of Au/Al(2)O(3)to enhance its absorption near the bandgap edge, the Se(0.32)Te(0.68)film (an optical bandgap of approximate to 0.8 eV)-based photoconductor exhibits a cut-off wavelength at approximate to 1.7 mu m and gives a responsivity of 1.5 AW(-1)and implied detectivity of 6.5 x 10(10)cm Hz(1/2)W(-1)at 1.55 mu m at room temperature. Importantly, the nature of the thermal evaporation process enables the fabrication of Se0.32Te0.68-based 42 x 42 focal plane arrays with good pixel uniformity, demonstrating the potential of this unique material system used for infrared imaging sensor systems.≈Ω [Tan, Chaoliang; Amani, Matin; Zhao, Chunsong; Hettick, Mark; Lien, Der-Hsien; Li, Hao; Yeh, Matthew; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tan, Chaoliang; Amani, Matin; Zhao, Chunsong; Hettick, Mark; Lien, Der-Hsien; Li, Hao; Yeh, Matthew; Javey, Ali] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Chunsong; Song, Xiaohui; Scott, Mary C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Song, Xiaohui; Scott, Mary C.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shrestha, Vivek Raj; Crozier, Kenneth B.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Phys, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Crozier, Kenneth B.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Crozier, Kenneth B.] Univ Melbourne, Australian Res Council ARC, Ctr Excellence Transformat Metaopt Syst TMOS, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australias University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourneo  Lien, Der-Hsien/GYD-6547-2022; Tan, Chaoliang/T-3036-2017; Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013; CROZIER, KENNETH/J-7143-2016¬ç  Lien, Der-Hsien/0000-0001-6774-2074; Tan, Chaoliang/0000-0003-1695-5285; Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; CROZIER, KENNETH/0000-0003-0947-001X> Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [HR0011-16-1-0004]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1201]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]¬• Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬Æ C.T. and M.A. contributed equally to this work.

Our emphasis is on the valuable insights acquired in recent computational analyses that have supplemented experimental investigations. The first idea is to use the local structural order developed, and in particular its evolution during undercooling, as a signature indicator to rationalize the experimentally observed temperature-dependence of viscosity, hence suggesting a possible structural origin of liquid fragility. The second issue concerns with the claim that the average nearest-neighbor distance in metallic melts contracts rather than expands upon heating, concurrent with a reduced coordination number. This postulate is, however, based on the shift of the first peak maximum in the pair distribution function and an average bond length determined from nearest neighbors designated using a distance cutoff. These can instead be a result of increasing skewness of the broad first peak, upon thermally exacerbated asymmetric distribution of neighboring atoms activated to shorter and longer distances under the anharmonic interatomic interaction potential. The third topic deals with crystal-like peak positions in the pair distribution function of metallic glasses. These peak locations can be explained using various connection schemes of coordination polyhedra, and found to be present already in high-temperature liquids without hidden crystal order. We also present an outlook to invite more in-depth computational research to fully settle these issues in future, and to establish more robust structure-property relations in amorphous alloys.‚Äì  [Ding, Jun] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ma, En] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USAi  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Johns Hopkins University√Ä  Ding, J (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Ma, E (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.  ding@lbl.gov; ema@jhu.edu  Ding, Jun/0000-0002-4091-8663√¥  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, through the Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [KC13, DE-AC02-05CH11231];  [NSF-DMR-1505621]√≤  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, through the Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); √ò We thank Dr Yongqiang Cheng and Profs.

At nanoparticle areal fractions above that for the onset of two-dimensional crystallization, structural reorganizations of the mobile polymer-coated particles were visualized after a stepwise areal compression. When the compression was small, slow shearing near dislocations and reconfigured nanoparticle bonding were observed at crystal grain boundaries. At larger scales, domains grew as they rotated into registry by correlated but highly intermittent motions. Simultaneously, the areal density in the middle of the monolayer increased. When the compression was large, the jammed monolayers exhibited out-of-plane deformations such as wrinkles and bumps. Due to their large interfacial binding energy, few (if any) of the two-dimensionally mobile nanoparticles returned to the liquid subphase. Compressed long enough (several hours or more), monolayers transformed into solid nanoparticle films, as evidenced by their cracking and localized rupturing upon subsequent areal expansion. These observations provide mechanistic insights into the dynamics of a simple model system that undergoes jamming/unjamming in response to mechanical stress.Z [Kim, Paul Y.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gao, Yige; Fink, Zachary; Ribbe, Alexander E.; Hoagland, David A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan¬´  United √Ω√ø√ø√ø              	

However, bioelectricity spans orders of magnitude in intensity, space, and time, posing substantial technological challenges. The development of methods permitting network-scale recordings with high spatial resolution remains key to studies of electrogenic cells, emergent networks, and bioelectric computation. Here, we demonstrate single-shot and label-free imaging of extracellular potentials with high resolution across a wide field-of-view. The critically coupled waveguide-amplified graphene electric field (CAGE) sensor leverages the field-sensitive optical transitions in graphene to convert electric potentials into the optical regime. As a proof-of-concept, we use the CAGE sensor to detect native electrical activity from cardiac action potentials with tens-of-microns resolution, simultaneously map the propagation of these potentials at tissue-scale, and monitor their modification by pharmacological agents. This platform is robust, scalable, and compatible with existing microscopy techniques for multimodal correlative imaging.√ô [Balch, Halleh B.; Horng, Jason; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Qi, Kevin K.; Duh, Yi-Shiou; Forrester, Patrick R.; Crommie, Michael F.; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Balch, Halleh B.; Horng, Jason; Crommie, Michael F.; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Balch, Halleh B.; Horng, Jason; Crommie, Michael F.; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Balch, Halleh B.; Horng, Jason; Crommie, Michael F.; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [McGuire, Allister F.; Cui, Bianxiao] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Horng, Jason] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USAt University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Stanford University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigant Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  fengwang76@berkeley.edu2  wang, Feng/I-5727-2015; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/J-1682-2016¬ç  wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/0000-0003-2097-0170; Balch, Halleh/0000-0003-4365-957X; Forrester, Patrick/0000-0001-8882-9048I U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1203]; National Institutes of Health [1R01NS121934]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1344302]; Stanford Bowes Bio-X Graduate Fellowship; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE 1106400]√ê U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Stanford Bowes Bio-X Graduate Fellowship; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))¬ù The authors thank Felix Alfonso for helpful discussions and Peter Schmehl for 3D printing resources.

New methods are needed to access and manipulate such currents with timescales that are compatible with modern electronics. Here we reveal that an optically induced long-lived (similar to 10 ns), spin-polarized surface state excitation in topological insulators can be easily tuned in both magnitude and duration. Time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, together with a quantitative model, reveals the ideal conditions for a surface photovoltage in two different topological insulators. Our model predicts that the reported effects are an intrinsic property of topological insulators, as long as the chemical potential falls within the band gap. This work demonstrates that persistent excited topological surface states are photon-accessible and easily tuned in both magnitude and duration, merging photonics- and spintronics-based devices in the same material.√ª [Ciocys, Samuel; Morimoto, Takahiro; Analytis, James G.; Moore, Joel E.; Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ciocys, Samuel; Mori, Ryo; Gotlieb, Kenneth; Analytis, James G.; Moore, Joel E.; Lanzara, Alessandra] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mori, Ryo; Gotlieb, Kenneth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hussain, Zahid] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬æ  Lanzara, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Lanzara, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.[  Hussain, Zahid/HGU-8912-2022; Morimoto, Takahiro/L-9826-2018; analytis, james/ABE-6100-2020≈Ω  Hussain, Zahid/0000-0003-4989-6496; Morimoto, Takahiro/0000-0003-4825-7377; analytis, james/0000-0002-7657-7688; Mori, Ryo/0000-0002-8684-9421‚Äô Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy, as part of the Ultrafast Materials Science Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC2203]; National Science Foundation [DGE1852814, DGE1106400, 1607753]; EPiQS Initiative of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF4537]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's EPiQS grant [GBMF4838]‚Äπ Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy, as part of the Ultrafast Materials Science Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); EPiQS Initiative of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's EPiQS grantO We thank C.H.

However, to realize the three-dimensional printing of one liquid in another, high-viscosity liquids, for example, silicone oil, have been generally used. Here, we present a simple, low-cost approach to print water in low-viscosity toluene by using a new type of polyelectrolyte surfactant, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose surfactant (CMCS), that forms and assembles at the oil-water interface. The interfacial activity of CMCSs can be enhanced by tuning parameters, such as pH and concentration, and the incorporation of a rigid ligand affords excellent mechanical strength to the resultant assemblies. With CMCS jammed at the interface, liquids can be easily printed or molded to the desired shapes, with biocompatible walls that can be used to encapsulate and adsorb active materials. This study opens a new pathway to generate complex, all-liquid devices with a myriad of potential applications in biology, catalysis, and chemical separation.m [Xu, Ruiyan; Liu, Tan; Sun, Huilou; Wang, Beibei; Shi, Shaowei; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAe Shi, SW; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.≈æ This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51903011) and Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2194083).

Whereas the existence of new moire excitonic states is established(1-4) through optical measurements, the microscopic nature of these states is still poorly understood, often relying on empirically fit models. Here, combining large-scale first-principles GW (where G and W denote the one-particle Green's function and the screened Coulomb interaction, respectively) plus Bethe-Salpeter calculations and micro-reflection spectroscopy, we identify the nature of the exciton resonances in WSe2/WS2 moire superlattices, discovering a rich set of moire excitons that cannot be captur<    ed by prevailing continuum models. Our calculations show moire excitons with distinct characters, including modulated Wannier excitons and previously unidentified intralayer charge-transfer excitons. Signatures of these distinct excitonic characters are confirmed experimentally by the unique carrier-density and magnetic-field dependences of different moire exciton resonances. Our study highlights the highly non-trivial exciton states that can emerge in transition metal dichalcogenide moire superlattices, and suggests new ways of tuning many-body physics in moire systems by engineering excited-states with specific spatial characters.J [Naik, Mit H.; Regan, Emma C.; Zhang, Zuocheng; Chan, Yang-Hao; Li, Zhenglu; Wang, Danqing; Yoon, Yoseob; Ong, Chin Shen; Zhao, Wenyu; Utama, M.

Integrating these 2D nanosheets into 3D monoliths offers an exciting and powerful platform for translating their fundamental advantages into practical applications. Introducing internal pores, such as isotropic pores and aligned channels, within the monoliths can not only address the restacking of MXenes, but also afford a series of novel and, in some cases, unique structural merits to advance the utility of the MXene-based materials. Here, a brief overview of the development of MXene-based porous monoliths, in terms of the types of microstructures, is provided, focusing on the pore design and how the porous microstructure affects the application performance. [Yang, Yang; Li, Kaijuan; Wang, Yaxin; Wu, Zhanpeng; Shi, Shaowei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 0100<    3 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shi, Shaowei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Synth & Applicat Waterborne, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China Wu, ZP; Shi, SW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Shi, SW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Synth & Applicat Waterborne, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.I  wuzp@mail.buct.edu.cn; russell@mail.pse.umass.edu; shisw@mail.buct.edu.cnE  Russell, Thomas/0000-0001-6384-5826; Shi, Shaowei/0000-0002-9869-4340 National Natural Science Foundation of China [51903011, 52173018]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [2222071]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]¬§ work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51903011, 52173018) and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2222071).

A computational screening approach to identify high-performance multivalent intercalation cathodes among materials that do not contain the working ion of interest has been developed, which greatly expands the search space that can be considered for material discovery. This approach has been applied to magnesium cathodes as a proof of concept, and four resulting candidate materials [NASICON V2(PO4)3, birnessite NaMn4O8, tavorite MnPO4F, and spinel MnO2] are discussed in further detail. In examining the ion migration environment and associated Mg2+ migration energy in these materials, local energy maxima are found to correspond with pathway positions where Mg2+ passes through a plane of anion atoms. While previous studies have established the influence of local coordination on multivalent ion mobility, these results suggest that considering both the type of the local bonding environment and available free volume for the mobile ion along its migration pathway can be significant for improving solid-state mobility.√´  [Rutt, Ann; Shen, Jimmy-Xuan; Horton, Matthew; Kim, Jiyoon; Lin, Jerry; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√Å  Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.F  Rutt, Ann/0000-0001-6534-454X; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509√∏  Volkswagen group; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231] Volkswagen group; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE))≈† This work was supported by the Volkswagen group.

However, there remains a knowledge gap on the formation of the supramolecule in solution. Here, we applied NMR techniques to investigate the solution-phase behavior of the most studied supramolecular systems, polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine)(3-pentadecylphenol) (PS-b-P4VP(PDP)(r)). The results show that the supramolecule likely adopts a coil-comb conformation, despite the small molecule's (PDP) rapid exchange between the bonded and free states. The exchange rate (>10(4) s(-1)) exceeds the NMR time scale at the frequency of interest. The supramolecules form under dilute conditions (similar to 2, vol %) and are attributed to the enthalpic gain of the hydrogen bonding between the PDP and 4VP. As the solute concentration increases (>10 vol %), the supramolecule forms micelle-like aggregates with PDP accumulated within the comb-block's pervaded volume based on analysis of the apparent molecular weight, viscosity, and chain dynamics. This work sheds light on the long-standing question regarding the evolution of the constituents in the BCP-based supramolecule in solution and provides valuable guidance toward their solution-based processing and morphological control.¬º  [Chang, Boyce S.; Ma, Le; He, Mengdi; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬æ  Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.#  Chang, Boyce S./0000-0001-8683-3369¬™  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]; NIH [S10OD024998] U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)¬• This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104).

Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to demonstrate that molecules deposited onto graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) exhibit reversible, electrically tunable surface concentration. Continuous gate-tunable control over the surface concentration of charged F(4)TCNQ molecules was achieved on a graphene FET at T = 4.5K. This capability enables the precisely controlled impurity doping of graphene devices and also provides a new method for determining molecular energy level alignment based on the gate-dependence of molecular concentration. Gate-tunable molecular concentration is explained by a dynamical molecular rearrangement process that reduces total electronic energy by maintaining Fermi level pinning in the device substrate. The molecular surface concentration is fully determined by the device back-gate voltage, its geometric capacitance, and the energy difference between the graphene Dirac point and the molecular LUMO level.¬† [Liou, Franklin; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Aikawa, Andrew S.; Natividad, Kyler C.; Tang, Eric; Ha, Ethan; Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liou, Franklin; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Aikawa, Andrew S.; Natividad, Kyler C.; Tang, Eric; Ha, Ethan; Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liou, Franklin; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Aikawa, Andrew S.; Natividad, Kyler C.; Tang, Eric; Ha, Ethan; Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Riss, Alexander] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept E20, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Watanabe, Kenji] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Res Ctr Funct Mat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Int Ctr Mat Nanoarchitecton, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Lischner, Johannes] Imperial Coll London, Dept Mat, London SW7 2BB, Englandd University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Technical University of Munich; National Institute for Materials Science; National Institute for Materials Science; Imperial College London, Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  crommie@berkeley.edu  Watanabe, Kenji/ABB-2135-2021#  Watanabe, Kenji/0000-0003-3701-8119¬• Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1203]; National Science Foundation [DMR1807233]; Elemental Strategy Initiative by MEXT, Japan [JPMXP0112101001]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP20H00354]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [453903355]; Kavli ENSI Philomathia Graduate Student Fellowshipg Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Elemental Strategy Initiative by MEXT, Japan; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research<     Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Kavli ENSI Philomathia Graduate Student FellowshipX This research was supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy under contract no.

Recent research indicating that falls in the elderly might be the consequence of fracture rather than its cause has raised fundamental questions about the origin of fragility fractures. Is day-to-day cyclic loading, instead of a single-load event such as a fall, the main cause of progressively growing fractures? Are fragility fractures predominantly affected by bone quality rather than bone mass, which is the clinical indicator of fracture risk? Do osteocytes actively participate in the bone repair process? In this Perspective, we discuss the central role of cyclic fatigue in bone fragility fracture.‚Äî [Acevedo, Claire; Alliston, Tamara] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Orthopaed Surg, San Francisco, CA 94131 USA; [Acevedo, Claire; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Acevedo, Claire] Univ Utah, Dept Mech Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Stadelmann, Vincent A.] AO Res Inst Davos, Davos Pl, Davos, Switzerland; [Stadelmann, Vincent A.] SCANCO Med AG, Bruettisellen, Switzerland; [Pioletti, Dominique P.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Inst Bioengn, Lab Biomech Orthoped, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAj University of California System; University of California San Francisco; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of California System; University of California Berkeley. Acevedo, C (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Orthopaed Surg, San Francisco, CA 94131 USA.;Acevedo, C (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Acevedo, C (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Mech Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.  claire.acevedo@utah.edu^  Stadelmann, Vincent A./X-1543-2018; Acevedo, Claire/R-6711-2016; Ritchie, Robert O/A-8066-2008s  Acevedo, Claire/0000-0001-5425-3052; Ritchie, Robert O/0000-0002-0501-6998; Stadelmann, Vincent/0000-0002-8741-2184a Swiss National Science Foundation [PBELP2_141095, P300P2_167583]; NIH-NIDCR [R01 DE019284]; DOD PRORP [OR130191]; Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC13]√© Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); NIH-NIDCR(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)); DOD PRORP; Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division√¶ We acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation grants PBELP2_141095 and P300P2_167583 (C.A.), from NIH-NIDCR R01 DE019284 (T.A.) and from DOD PRORP OR130191 (T.A.).

The observation of electron-hole asymmetry in graphene and recently in twisted graphene and moire heterostructures has spurred interest into whether it stems from single-particle effects or from correlations, which are core to the emergence of intriguing phases in moire systems. Here, we report an effective way to access electron-hole asymmetry in 2D materials by directly measuring the quasiparticle self-energy in graphene/Boron Nitride field-effect devices. As the chemical potential moves from the hole to the electron-doped side, we see an increased strength of electronic correlations manifested by an increase in the band velocity and inverse quasiparticle lifetime. These results suggest that electronic correlations intrinsically drive the electron-hole asymmetry in graphene and by leveraging this asymmetry can provide alternative avenues to generate exotic phases in twisted moire heterostructures.√¥ [Dale, Nicholas; Mori, Ryo; Stansbury, Conrad; Fatuzzo, Claudia G.; Zhao, Sihan; Lee, Kyunghoon; Wang, Feng; Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dale, Nicholas; Utama, M.

Less common are liquid-like assemblies of colloidal nanocrystals in a condensed phase, which may have different energy transduction behaviors owing to their dynamic character. Limiting investigations into dynamic colloidal nanocrystal architectures is the lack of schemes to control or redirect the tendency of the system to solidify. We show how to solidify and subsequently reconfigure colloidal nanocrystal assemblies dimensionally confined to a liquid-liquid interface. Our success in this regard hinged on the development of competitive chemistries anchoring or releasing the nanocrystals to or from the interface. With these chemistries, it was possible to control the kinetic trajectory between quasi-two-dimensional jammed (solid-like) and unjammed (liquid-like) states. In future schemes, it may be possible to leverage this control to direct the formation or destruction of explicit physical pathways for energy carriers to migrate in the system in response to an external field.g [Zhang, Ziyi; Chai, Yu; Goldfine, Elise; Feng, Wenqian; Williams, Teresa E.; Ashby, Paul D.; Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Ziyi; Chai, Yu] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hearst Min Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jiang, Yufeng; Huang, Caili; Liu, Feng; Forth, Joe; Ashby, Paul D.; Russell, Thomas P.; Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, World Premier Int Res Ctr Initiat, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan¬£ Helms, BA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP; Helms, BA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, World Premier Int Res Ctr Initiat, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.(  tom.p.russell@gmail.com; bahelms@lbl.gov9  Liu, Feng/J-4361-2014; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022 Liu, Feng/0000-0002-5572-8512; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Goldfine, Elise/0000-0001-8268-1249; Williams, Teresa/0000-0002-9493-7026; Zhang, Ziyi/0000-0001-9102-8292; Ashby, Paul/0000-0003-4195-310X; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321; Forth, Joe/0000-0001-7263-6364J U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KCTR16]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]D U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)), This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

SPSs at the oil-water interface are confirmed by in situ real-space atomic force microcopy imaging. The assemblies of these aggregates can jam at the interface, opening a novel route to kinetically trap the liquids in non-equilibrium shapes. The elastic film, comprised of SPSs, wrinkles upon compression, providing a strategy to stabilize liquids in non-equilibrium shapes.√π [Gu, Pei-Yang; Xu, Qing-Feng; Lu, Jian-Mei] Soochow Univ, Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Collaborat Innovat, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Hou, Honghao; Xie, Ganhua; Jiang, Yufeng; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu; Ashby, Paul D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Feng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr IFSA CICIFSA, Dept Phys & Astron, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R ChinaO Soochow University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology" Lu, JM (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Collaborat Innovat, Suzhou, Peoples R China.;Liu, F (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr IFSA CICIFSA, Dept Phys & Astron, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.C  fengliu82@sjtu.edu.cn; lujm@suda.edu.cn; russell@mail.pse.umass.edup  Liu, Feng/J-4361-2014; gu, peiyang/HJH-4059-2023; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; Hou, Honghao/HKN-1747-2023‚Ä°  Liu, Feng/0000-0002-5572-8512; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Hou, Honghao/0000-0002-7133-9760; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321I This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

At the same time, we develop a comprehensive transport model that enables us to understand various features, such as obscuring of localized states in through transport, the effect of topology on transport, as well as negative differential conductance in heterostructures with localized electronic modes.

A topological fl<    at band, also known as a drumhead state, is an ideal platform to drive new exotic topological quantum phases. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments, we reveal the emergence of a highly localized surface state in a topological semimetal BaAl4 and provide its full energy and momentum space topology. We find that the observed surface state is localized in momentum, inside a square-shaped bulk Dirac nodal loop, and in energy, leading to a flat band and a peak in the density of state. These results imply this class of materials as an experimental realization of drumhead surface states and provide an important reference for future studies of the fundamental physics of correlated quantum effects in topological materials.√ç [Mori, Ryo; Ciocys, Samu√Ω√ø√ø√ø‚Äö  ∆í  ‚Äû  ‚Ä¶  ‚Ä†  ‚Ä°  ÀÜ  ‚Ä∞  ≈†  ‚Äπ  ≈í  ¬ç  ≈Ω  ¬è  ¬ê  ‚Äò  ‚Äô  ‚Äú  ‚Äù  ‚Ä¢  ‚Äì  ‚Äî  Àú  ‚Ñ¢  ≈°  ‚Ä∫  ≈ì  ¬ù  ≈æ  ≈∏  ¬†  ¬°  ¬¢  ¬£  ¬§  ¬•  ¬¶  ¬ß  ¬®  ¬©  ¬™  ¬´  ¬¨  ¬≠  ¬Æ  ¬Ø  ¬∞  ¬±  ¬≤  ¬≥  ¬¥  ¬µ  ¬∂  ¬∑  ¬∏  ¬π  ¬∫  ¬ª  ¬º  ¬Ω  ¬æ  ¬ø  √Ä  √Å  √Ç  √É  √Ñ  √Ö  √Ü  √á  √à  √â  √ä  √ã  √å  √ç  √é  √è  √ê  √ë  √í  √ì  √î  √ï  √ñ  √ó  √ò  √ô  √ö  √õ  √ú  √ù  √û  √ü  √†  √°  √¢  √£  √§  √•  √¶  √ß  √®  √©  √™  √´  √¨  √≠  √Æ  √Ø  √∞  √±  √≤  √≥  √¥  √µ  √∂  √∑  √∏  √π  √∫  √ª  √º  √Ω  √æ  √ø    el; Lanzara, Alessandra] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mori, Ryo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Kefeng; Paglione, Johnpierre] Univ Maryland, Maryland Quantum Mat Ctr, Dept Phys, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Morimoto, Takahiro] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Morimoto, Takahiro] JST, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Ciocys, Samuel; Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Denlinger, Jonathan D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Kefeng] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA√í United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Tokyo; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Rutgers State University New Brunswick‚Ä∫  ryomori@berkeley.edu; kw624@physics.rutgers.edu; morimoto@ap.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp; sciocys@berkeley.edu; jddenlinger@lbl.gov; paglione@umd.edu; Alanzara@lbl.gov¬µ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's EPiQS Initiative [GBMF9071]; Maryland Quantum Materials Center; JST PRESTO [JPMJPR19L9]; JST CREST [JPMJCR19T3]; Advanced Light Source, a DOE Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC0205CH11231]; Ultrafast Materials Science Program KC2203 [DE-AC02-05CH11231]6 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's EPiQS Initiative; Maryland Quantum Materials Center; JST PRESTO(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); JST CREST(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)); Advanced Light Source, a DOE Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Ultrafast Materials Science Program KC22035 The experimental part of this work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (Quantum materials KC2202), while the data analysis of this work, based on the PyARPES software developed by our group, was supported by Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 (Ultrafast Materials Science Program KC2203).

Controlling the structure and morphology of Cu nanostructures during synthesis is crucial for achieving desired properties. Here, we studied temperature effects on electrochemical deposition of Cu nanoparticles. We found the size, nucleation density, and crystallinity of Cu nanoparticles are strongly influenced by low temperature processing. The electrodeposition at low temperature (-20 degrees C) results in clusters of assembled small Cu nanoparticles, which is distinctly different from the large individual highly crystalline Cu nanoparticles obtained from the room temperature process. The differences in Cu nanoparticle morphology and crystallinity are attributed to the variations in reduction reaction rate and surface diffusion. The limitation of the reaction rate promotes multiple nuclei, and low surface diffusion induce spoor crystallinity. This study deepens our understanding of low-temperature effects on electrochemical processes assisting the design of diverse hierarchical catalytic materials.√æ  [Zhang, Qiubo; Wan, Jiawei; Shangguan, Junyi; Betzler, Sophia; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wan, Jiawei; Shangguan, Junyi; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAd  Wan, Jiawei/0000-0002-3805-5133; Zhang, Qiubo/0000-0002-1649-9876; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170√é  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sci-ences (BES) , Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC22ZH]; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√±  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sci-ences (BES) , Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))‚Ä¢ This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sci-ences (BES) , Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the in-situ TEM program (KC22ZH) .

To understand the interfacial behavior of NPSs, it is necessary to understand the mechanism by which the NPSs attach to the interface and how this attachment depends on the areal coverage of the interface. Through direct observation with high spatial and temporal resolution, using laser scanning confocal microscopy and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), we observe that early-stage attachment of NPs to the interface is diffusion limited and with increasing areal density of the NPSs, further attachment requires cooperative displacement of the previously assembled NPSs both laterally and vertically. The unprecedented detail provided by in situ AFM rev<    eals the complex mechanism of attachment and the deeply nonequilibrium nature of the assembly.‚Äô [Chai, Yu; Li, Dong; Helms, Brett A.; Ashby, Paul D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Kowloon, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hasnain, Jaffar; Wong, Matthew; Geissler, Phillip] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bahl, Kushaan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Geissler, Phillip; Kim, Paul Y.; Jiang, Yufeng; Gu, Peiyang; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.; Ashby, Paul D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jiang, Yufeng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gu, Peiyang] Soochow Univ, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Li, Siqi] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lei, Dangyuan] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Kowloon, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japanm United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; City University of Hong Kong; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Soochow University - China; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Tohoku University‚Äî Ashby, PD (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP; Ashby, PD (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan."  tprussell@lbl.gov; pdashby@lbl.govq  gu, peiyang/HJH-4059-2023; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; Lei, Dangyuan/B-9812-2011; Kim, Paul/GYV-3258-2022√é  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Lei, Dangyuan/0000-0002-8963-0193; Kim, Paul/0000-0003-0943-4924; Wong, Matthew/0000-0002-1709-9612; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321; Jiang, Yufeng/0000-0002-1705-5863  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KCTR16]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]$ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))

The interfacial interconversion of H6TPPS, specifically H4TPPS2- dissolved in water, from J- to an H-aggregation was induced by strong electrostatic interactions with amine-terminated polystyrene dissolved in toluene at the water/toluene interface. This resulted in color-tunable liquids due to interfacial jamming of the SPSs formed between H4TPPS2- and amine-terminated polystyrene. However, the formed SPSs cannot lock in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids. In addition, a self-wrinkling behavior was observed when amphiphilic triblock copolymers of PS-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) were used to interact with H4TPPS2-. Subsequently, the SPSs formed can lock in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids., [Gu, Pei-Yang; Xu, Qing-Feng; Lu, Jian-Mei] Soochow Univ, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Gu, Pei-Yang; Xie, Ganhua; Kim, Paul Y.; Chai, Yu; Wu, Xuefei; Jiang, Yufeng; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Feng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr IFSA CICIFSA, Dept Phys & Astron, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xuefei; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Wu, Xuefei; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China Lu, JM (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.V  gu, peiyang/HJH-4059-2023; Kim, Paul/GYV-3258-2022; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022e  Kim, Paul/0000-0003-0943-4924; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321≈í The interfacial assembly, jamming and chromogenic behavior were supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

To inherit the microstructures of biological materials, nickel-plated luffa sponges were fabricated through electrochemical deposition using natural luffa sponges as templates. Four groups of samples were processed based on nickel electroless and electroplating, and then characterized by X-ray diffraction and optical/scanning electron microscopy. Axial compression tests were performed to characterize the mechanical properties of the nickel-plated samples to compare with those of the original natural sponges. Results showed that a uniform layer of nickel was formed on the luffa fibers by electroless plating; conversely, by electroplating the nickel only minimal deposits were found on the inner luffa wall due to the uneven current distribution over the surface of sponge. Accordingly, electroless plating was deemed to be far more effective for metal deposition of materials with complex structures, such as luffa sponge. Alkali treatments prior to plating were found to be critical for subsequent mechanical performance and energy absorption capacity. The mechanical properties of nickel-plated samples surpass those of original luffa sponges, with the enhancement efficiency, i.e., the ratio of specific stiffness and strength, being highest for electroless-plated samples with a prior alkali treatment. Specifically, their energy absorption capacity was far superior to that in other comparable materials. Using a power scaling law, an empirical relationship was derived which indicated that the bending-dominated behavior of the nickel plated luffa sponges was similar to that of open-cell foams. We believe that other artificially bio-inherited materials could be successfully processed and developed in this manner. The superior properties of bio-in-herited materials that we obtained in this work may provide inspiration for future research efforts on bio-inspired structural materials.5 [Yin, Sha; Wang, Huitian; Li, Jiani; Xu, Jun] Beihang Univ, Dept Automot Engn, Sch Transportat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Yin, Sha; Wang, Huitian; Li, Jiani; Xu, Jun] Beihang Univ, AVRC, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Yin, Sha] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Strength & Vibrat Mech Struct, Sch Aerosp Engn, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA Beihang University; Beihang University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley[ Xu, J (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Dept Automot Engn, Sch Transportat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.$  roritchie@lbl.gov; junxu@buaa.edu.cn2  Xu, Jun/B-2260-2016; Ritchie, Robert O/A-8066-2008B  Xu, Jun/0000-0002-8619-8737; Ritchie, Robert O/0000-0002-0501-6998 National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0103703]; Chinese Academy of Space Technology [CAST-BISEE2017-021]; Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST; State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures, Xi'an Jiaotong University [SV2016-KF-20]; Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [KC13]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√∞ National Key Research and Development Program of China; Chinese Academy of Space Technology; Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST; State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures, Xi'an Jiaotong University; Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))‚Äî J.X. and S.Y. were financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFB0103703), Chinese Academy of Space Technology (CAST-BISEE2017-021), Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST, and Opening fund of State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures, Xi'an Jiaotong University (SV2016-KF-20).

However, the behavior of thin liquids encapsulated in a graphene liquid cell has not been fully understood. Here, we report real rime TEM imaging of the nanoscale dynamic behavior of liquids in graphene nanocapillaries. Our observations reveal that the interfaces between liquid and gas bubble can fluctuate, leading to the generation of liquid nanodroplets near the interfaces. Liquid nanodroplets often show irregular shape with dynamic changes of their configuration under the electron beam. We consider that the dynamic motion of liquid-gas interfaces might be introduced by the electrostatic energy from transiently charged interfaces. We find that improving the wettability of graphene liquid cells by ultraviolet-ozone treatment can significantly modify the dynamic motion of the encapsulated liquids. Our study provides valuable information of the interactions between liquid and graphene under the electron beam, and it also offers key insights on the nanoscale fluid dynamics in confined spaces." [Yang, Jiwoong; Alam, Sardar B.; Yu, Lei; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chan, Emory] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yu, Lei; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAb  Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.5  Alam, Sardar Bilal/ABG-5910-2020; Yu, Lei/P-1071-2019f  Yu, Lei/0000-0002-3975-8930; Alam, Sardar Bilal/0000-0002-3906-2837; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the insitu TEM program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC22ZH]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231] U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the insitu TEM<     program; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))≈Ω This work was funded by U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the insitu TEM program (KC22ZH).

This makes them highly suitable for the construction of compact high field magnets of several tens of tesla. However, with increasing current density and magnetic field come high Lorentz loads and high strain levels, and it is empirically known that superconducting properties are affected by strain. The superconducting properties of the most commonly used high field material, Nb3Sn, are particularly badly affected by strain. Here we demonstrate that strain causes significant sub-lattice distortion in the A15 lattice structure of Nb3Sn, and show how this leads to the relatively large reduction of its superconducting properties. The changes are found to be primarily due to changes in the electron density of states, with a lesser contribution due to changes in the phonon spectrum. The amount of sub-lattice distortion further depends on crystal orientation. These findings suggest that it is possible to mitigate the reduction of the current carrying capacity by strain through crystal alignment and sub-lattice stabilization. This would enable superconducting magnets to reach a significantly higher magnetic field, and ease their construction by simplifying react-and-wind coil fabrication.9 [Godeke, A.] Varian Med Syst Particle Therapy GmbH, Troisdorf, Germany; [Hellman, F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hellman, F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA USA; [ten Kate, H.

Here, we use hydrodynamics experiments to probe how the magnetization of FMLDs and their response to external stimuli can be tuned by chemical, structural, and magnetic means. The remanent magnetization stems from magnetic NPs jammed at the liquid-liquid interface and dispersed NPs magneto-statically coupled to the interface. FMLDs form even at low concentrations of magnetic NPs when mixing nonmagnetic and magnetic NPs, since the underlying magnetic dipole-driven clustering of magnetic NP-surfactants at the interface produces local magnetic properties, similar to those found with pure magnetic NP solutions. While the net magnetization is smaller, such a clustering of NPs may enable structured liquids with heterogeneous surfaces. [Wu, Xuefei; Liu, Xubo; Wang, Dong; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xuefei; Liu, Xubo; Wang, Dong] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xuefei; Streubel, Robert; Liu, Xubo; Kim, Paul Y.; Chai, Yu; Hu, Qin; Fischer, Peter; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Streubel, Robert] Univ Nebraska, Dept Phys & Astron, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Streubel, Robert] Univ Nebraska, Nebraska Ctr Mat & Nanosci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Liu, Xubo] Chinese Acad Sci, Tech Inst Phys & Chem, CAS Key Lab Bioinspired Mat & Interfacial Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Chai, Yu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chai, Yu] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hu, Qin; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Hu, Qin] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Microelect, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Fischer, Peter] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Phys Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, World Premier Inst, Adv Inst Mat Res, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan√ë Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Technical Institute of Physics & Chemistry, CAS; City University of Hong Kong; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Tohoku Universityl Wang, D; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Wang, D (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Streubel, R; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, World Premier Inst, Adv Inst Mat Res, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.A  streubel@unl.edu; dwang@mail.buct.edu.cn; tom.p.russell@gmail.comu  Fischer, Peter/U-5337-2019; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; Kim, Paul/GYV-3258-2022; Streubel, Robert/D-9686-2012√é  Fischer, Peter/0000-0002-9824-934<    3; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Kim, Paul/0000-0003-0943-4924; Streubel, Robert/0000-0003-4783-892X; Liu, Xubo/0000-0002-2231-0208; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321¬† US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering at Beijing University of Chemical Technology√Ç US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering at Beijing University of Chemical Technologya This work was supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

The resulting band structure features a pair of extremely flat bands across most of the mini-Brillouin zone. Further details depend sensitively on the symmetries of the heterostructure; we find semiconducting band structures when all twofold rotations around the in-plane axis are broken, and semimetallic band structures otherwise. We calculate the Chern numbers of the different isolated bands, and identify the parameter regimes and filling factors where valley Chern insulators and topological insulators are realized. Interestingly, we find that for realistic values of the proximity-induced terms, it is possible to realize a topological insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry by doping two holes or two electrons per superlattice unit cell into the system. [Wang, Tianle; Bultinck, Nick; Zaletel, Michael P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phi Sics, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Tianle; Zaletel, Michael P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bultinck, Nick] Univ Ghent, Dept Phys, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium¬•  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Ghent University¬æ  Wang, TL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phi Sics, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, TL (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.D  Bultinck, Nick/0000-0002-2781-4085; Wang, Tianle/0000-0001-6602-0061¬ù  Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCWF16]¬™  Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬Å It is a pleasure to thank Andrea Young, Ashvin Vishwanath, Eslam Khalaf, and Shubhayu Chatterjee for useful discussions.

However, the atomic pathways of nanostructure ripening in solution have rarely been observed directly. Here, we report defect-mediated ripening of Cd-CdCl2 core-shell nanoparticles (CSN) revealed by in-situ atomic resolution imaging with liquid cell transmission electron microscopy. We find that ripening is initiated by dissolution of the nanoparticle with an incomplete CdCl2 shell, and that the areas of the Cd core that are exposed to the solution are etched first. The growth of the other nanoparticles is achieved by generating crack defects in the shell, followed by ion diffusion through the cracks. Subsequent healing of crack defects leads to a highly crystalline CSN. The formation and annihilation of crack defects in the CdCl2 shell, accompanied by disordering and crystallization of the shell structure, mediate the ripening of Cd-CdCl2 CSN in the solution. Understanding the ripening of core-shell nanostructures is challenging. Here, the authors use liquid cell transmission electron microscopy to show that the atomic ripening pathway for Cd-CdCl2 core-shell nanoparticles is mediated by crack defects.√É [Zhang, Qiubo; Nie, Yifan; Zheng, Qi; Shangguan, Junyi; Wang, Linwang; Limmer, David T.; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustillo, Karen C.; Ercius, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Elect Microscopy Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shangguan, Junyi; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhu, Chao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Limmer, David T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Limmer, David T.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Chem Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Limmer, David T.] Kavli Energy Nanosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√Ø United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory1  wang, lin/GSE-3040-2022; wang, lili/HDL-7210-2022d  Zhu, Chao/0000-0001-6383-3665; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Wang, Lin-Wang/0000-0001-7061-2692√å  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC22ZH]; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√Ø  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))‚Äò This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the in-situ TEM program (KC22ZH).

Here, we show that coacervate-encased droplets of an aqueous polymer solution can be hung from the surface of a less dense aqueous polymer solution using surface tension. The forces acting on and the shapes of the hanging droplets can be controlled. Sacs with homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces are hung from the surface and, by capillary forces, form well-ordered arrays. Locomotion and rotation can be achieved by embedding magnetic microparticles within the assemblies.

We present a setup for trARPES with 22.3 eV extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) femtosecond pulses at 50-kHz repetition rate, which enables fast data acquisition and access to dynamics across momentum space with high sensitivity. The design and operation of the XUV beamline, pump-probe setup, and ultra-high vacuum endstation are described in detail. By characterizing the effect of space-charge broadening, we determine an ultimate source-limited energy resolution of 60 meV, with typically 80-100 meV obtained at 1-2 x 10(10) photons/s probe flux on the sample. The instrument capabilities are demonstrated via both equilibrium and time-resolved ARPES studies of transition-metal dichalcogenides. The 50-kHz repetition rate enables sensitive measurements of quasiparticles at low excitation fluences in semiconducting MoSe2, with an instrumental time resolution of 65 fs. Moreover, photo-induced phase transitions can be driven with the available pump fluence, as shown by charge density wave melting in 1T-TiSe2. The high repetition-rate setup thus provides a versatile platform for sensitive XUV trARPES, from quenching of electronic phases down to the perturbative limit.

In this work, we use high-throughput density functional theory calculations workflow to construct the Grain Boundary Database (GBDB), the largest database of DFT-computed grain boundary properties to date. The database currently encompasses 327 GBs of 58 elemental metals, including 10 common twist or symmetric tilt GBs for body-centered cubic (bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) systems and the Sigma 7 [0001] twist GB for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) systems. In particular, we demonstrate a novel scaled-structural template approach for HT GB calculations, which reduces the computational cost of converging GB structures by a factor of similar to 3-6. The grain boundary energies and work of separation are rigorously validated against previous experimental and computational data. Using this large GB dataset, we develop an improved predictive model for the GB energy of different elements based on the cohesive energy and shear modulus. The open GBDB represents a significant step forward in the availability of first principles GB properties, which we believe would help guide the future design of polycrystalline materials.

Using first-principles calculations, we introduce structural disorder in the trivial insulator BiTeI and observe the emergence of a topological insulating phase. By modifying the bonding environments, the crystal-field splitting is enhanced, with spin-orbit interactions producing a band inversion in the bulk electronic structure. Analysis of the Wannier charge centers and the surface electronic structure reveals a strong topological insulator with Dirac surface states. Finally, we propose a prescription for inducing topological states from disorder in crystalline materials. Understanding how local environments produce topological phases is a key step for predicting disordered and amorphous topological materials.q [Corbae, Paul; Hellman, Frances] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hellman, Frances] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Corbae, Paul; Hellman, Frances; Griffin, Sinead M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Griffin, Sinead M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA( University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory¬ø  Corbae, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Corbae, P (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  pcorbae@berkeley.edu   Corbae, Paul/0000-0002-2259-5557J US Department of Energy, Office of Science, National Quantum Informa-tion Science Research Centers, Quantum Systems Accelerator (QSA); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; US Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Nonequilibrium Magnetic Materials Program (MSMAG) [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [1752814]¬§ US Department of Energy, Office of Science, National Quantum Informa-tion Science Research Centers, Quantum Systems Accelerator (QSA); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Nonequilibrium Magnetic Materials Program (MSMAG)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))‚Äú This work was primarily funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, National Quantum Informa-tion Science Research Centers, Quantum Systems Accelerator (QSA).

Here we examine an equiatomic medium-entropy alloy containing only three elements, CrCoNi, as a single-phase face-centred cubic solid solution, which displays strength-toughness properties that exceed those of all high-entropy alloys and most multi-phase alloys. At room temperature, the alloy shows tensile strengths of almost 1 GPa, failure strains of similar to 70% and K-JIc fracture-toughness values above 200 MPa m(1/2); at cryogenic temperatures strength, ductility and toughness of the CrCoNi alloy improve to strength levels above 1.3 GPa, failure strains up to 90% and K-JIc values of 275 MPa m(1/2). Such properties appear to result from continuous steady strain hardening, which acts to suppress plastic instability, resulting from pronounced dislocation activity and deformation-induced nano-twinning.¬¨ [Gludovatz, Bernd; Thurston, Keli V.

The packing density of the amine-functionalized POSS assembly at the water/toluene interface can be tuned by varying the concentration, the pH value, and the degree of POSS functionalization. Functionalized POSS gives a higher interface coverage, and hence a lower interfacial tension, than nanoparticle surfactants formed by interactions between functionalized nanoparticles and polymeric ligands. Hydrogen-bonded POSS surfactants are more stable at the interface, offering some unique advantages for generating Pickering emulsions over typical micron-sized colloidal particles and ligand-stabilized nanoparticle surfactants.¬è [Hou, Honghao; Li, Jin; Li, Xiangming; Yin, Jie; Jiang, Xuesong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Met Matrix Composite Mat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Hou, Honghao; Forth, Joe; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hou, Honghao; Li, Jin; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China3 Shanghai Jiao Tong University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology√∑ Jiang, XS (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Met Matrix Composite Mat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (correspon<    ding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China./  ponygle@sjtu.edu.cn; russell@mail.pse.umass.edu>  Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; Hou, Honghao/HKN-1747-2023J  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Hou, Honghao/0000-0002-7133-9760¬¥ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science under the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; U.S. Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences under the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; China Scholarship Council; National Nature Science Foundation of China [51773144]; Shanghai Municipal Government [17JC1400700]√õ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science under the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies towards Structuring Liquids program; U.S. Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences under the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Municipal Government This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, and Basic Energy Sciences under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

The earliest HEA was the equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi Cantor alloy, but HEM now encompass a broad class of metallic and ceramic systems. The concept of utilizing the high entropy of mixing to develop stable multi-element alloys may not be scientifically correct but has produced extraordinary mechanical properties in specific HEAs, mainly CrCoNi-based alloys, associated with their continuous work-hardening rate that is sustained to large plastic strains (similar to 0.5) and at low temperatures. This, in combination with the high frictional forces on dislocations and a propensity for twinning, leads to outstandingly high fracture toughness values (exceeding 200 MPa.m(1/2)) and resistance to shear-band formation under dynamic loading. The critical shear strain for the onset of adiabatic shear band formation is similar to 7 for the Cantor alloy, much higher than that for conventional alloys, suggesting superior ballistic properties. The slower diffusion rates resulting from the multi-element environment contribute to the excellent intermediate temperature performance. We review the principal mechanical properties of these alloys with emphasis on the face-centered cubic systems, such as the CrCoNi-based alloys. Their favorable mechanical properties and ease of processing by conventional means suggest extensive utilization in many future structural applications.≈æ [Li, Zezhou; Meyers, Marc A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Nanoengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Li, Zezhou; Meyers, Marc A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zhao, Shiteng; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Shiteng; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAa University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√â  Meyers, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Nanoengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;Meyers, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.  mameyers@eng.ucsd.eduq  Zhao, Shiteng/AAP-2946-2021; Zhao, Shiteng/AAQ-5126-2020; Ritchie, Robert O/A-8066-2008; Meyers, Marc/A-2970-2016j  Zhao, Shiteng/0000-0003-4828-9651; Ritchie, Robert O/0000-0002-0501-6998; Meyers, Marc/0000-0003-1698-5396√ó U.S. Department of Energy through grant NNSA/SSAP [DE-NA0002080]; UCSD Center for High Energy Density Science (UCOP LAB FEES GRANT) [LFR-17-449059]; Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; University of California Research Laboratories [09-LR-06-118456-MEYM]; China Scholarship Council [201508020004]√≠ U.S. Department of Energy through grant NNSA/SSAP(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); UCSD Center for High Energy Density Science (UCOP LAB FEES GRANT); Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); University of California Research Laboratories; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)¬æ This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy through grant NNSA/SSAP (DE-NA0002080) and the UCSD Center for High Energy Density Science (UCOP LAB FEES GRANT ID: LFR-17-449059) (for S.Z. and M.A.M.), and through the Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under contract no.

First-principles calculations reveal that its origins are fundamentally magnetic, involving repulsion between like-spin Co-Cr and Cr-Cr pairs that is complemented by the formation of a magnetically aligned sublattice of second-nearest-neighbor Cr atoms. Ordering models following these principles are found to predict otherwise anomalous experimental measurements concerning both magnetization and atomic volumes across a range of compositions. In addition to demonstrating the impact of magnetic interactions and resulting chemical rearrangement, the possible explanation of experiments would imply that short-range order of this type is far more prevalent than previously realized.* [Walsh, Flynn; Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Walsh, Flynn] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ä  Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  Asta, Mark/0000-0002-8968-321X¬∫ US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Damage-Tolerance in Structural Materials (KC13) program [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a US Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NSF [ACI-1548562]; Department of Defense through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program√ª US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Damage-Tolerance in Structural Materials (KC13) program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a US Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Defense through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program≈í This work was supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 within the Damage-Tolerance in Structural Materials (KC13) program.

Although this situation is usually satisfied in a large class of two-dimensional materials, it falls short in describing the so-called CDW-like phase transition in layered tantalum ditelluride (TaTe2), accompanied by anomalous low temperature transport properties and a periodic lattice distortion (PLD). Here we combine angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction to directly access the charge and lattice structures in 1T-polytypic TaTe2 and study the anomalous phase transition. Our data reveal the presence of a surprising quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface with nesting (FSN) condition, despite its van der Waals layered structure. We find that the wave vectors of the FSN and PLD are different, suggesting the decoupled formation between charge and lattice orders. These conditions are accompanied by rich footprints in band structure, including Fermi surface suppression, minigaps, and satellite bands. Our results suggest that TaTe2 manifests intrinsic mixed dimensionality between its electronic and lattice structure and that the CDW-like phase transition is likely governed by multiple mechanisms. Our work provides routes for forging unconventional CDW phases and charge-lattice entanglement that would otherwise not be available in materials with fixed dimensionality.C [Lin, Yi; Huber, Maximillian; Siddiqui, Khalid M.; Moreschini, Luca; Ai, Ping; Lanzara, Alessandra] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rajpurohit, Sangeeta; Tan, Liang Z.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Eilbott, Daniel H.; Moreschini, Luca; Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhu, Yanglin; Mao, Zhiqiang] Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, 104 Davey Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Denlinger, Jonathan D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√É United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory_  Lin, Y (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  yilin@lbl.gov; ALanzara@lbl.govc  Ai, Ping/0000-0003-1571-0614; Rajpurohit, Sangeeta/0000-0003-0790<    -9957; Lin, Yi/0000-0003-0806-4538‚Ä¢ U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [KC2203, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Advanced Light Source, a U.S. DOE Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation through the Penn State 2D Crystal Consortium-Materials Innovation Platform (2DCC-MIP) [DMR-1539916]; Computational Materials Sciences Program - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division; Molecular Foundry, a DOE Office of Science User Facility by Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√´ U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Advanced Light Source, a U.S. DOE Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation through the Penn State 2D Crystal Consortium-Materials Innovation Platform (2DCC-MIP); Computational Materials Sciences Program - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Molecular Foundry, a DOE Office of Science User Facility by Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))? This work was primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 (Ultrafast Materials Science Program No. KC2203).

In this report, we theoretically predict that an extremely low exciton binding energy can be achieved in 2D perovskites by using high dielectric-constant organic components. We demonstrate that in (HOCH2CH2NH3)(2)Pbl(4), whose organic material has a high dielectric constant of 37, the dielectric confinement is largely reduced, and the exciton binding energy is 20-times smaller than that in conventional 2D perovskites. As a result, the photo-induced excitons can be thermally dissociated efficiently at room temperature, as clearly indicated from femtosecond transient absorption measurements. In addition, the mobility is largely improved due to the strong screening effect on charge impurities. Such low dielectric-confined 2D perovskites show excellent carrier extraction efficiency, and outstanding humidity resistance compared to conventional 2D perovskites.¬ª [Cheng, Bin; Li, Ting-You; Wei, Pai-Chun; Ho, Kang-Ting; Lin, Chun-Ho; Liang, Ru-Ze; He, Jr-Hau] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Maity, Partha; Ajia, Idris A.; Yin, Jun; Roqan, Iman S.; Mohammed, Omar F.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, KAUST Solar Ctr, Phys Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Nordlund, Dennis; Sokaras, Dimosthenis] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lightsource, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Lien, Der-Hsien; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miao, Xiaohe] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Core Labs, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia= King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology‚Äö  He, JH (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.  jrhau.he@kaust.edu.sab Miao, Xiaohe/CAF-2593-2022; Miao, Xiaohe/CAF-4485-2022; Sokaras, Dimosthenis/G-6037-2010; He, Jr-Hau/B-5141-2011; Nordlund, Dennis/A-8902-2008; Maity, Partha/I-3161-2017; Yin, Jun/R-1448-2019; Roqan, Iman/H-5853-2019; Lien, Der-Hsien/GYD-6547-2022; Lin, Chun-Ho/ABG-4831-2020; Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013; Mohammed, Omar F./Q-5092-2016; He, Jr-Hau/Y-2620-2019¬ç Miao, Xiaohe/0000-0001-5997-609X; Miao, Xiaohe/0000-0001-5997-609X; Sokaras, Dimosthenis/0000-0001-8117-1933; He, Jr-Hau/0000-0003-1886-9241; Nordlund, Dennis/0000-0001-9524-6908; Maity, Partha/0000-0002-0293-7118; Yin, Jun/0000-0002-1749-1120; Roqan, Iman/0000-0001-7442-4330; Lien, Der-Hsien/0000-0001-6774-2074; Lin, Chun-Ho/0000-0003-0882-4728; Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; Mohammed, Omar F./0000-0001-8500-1130; He, Jr-Hau/0000-0003-1886-9241; Liang, Ru-Ze/0000-0002-1732-6133; Cheng, Bin/0000-0002-2932-4370; Li, Ting-You/0000-0003-1430-9247; Ho, Kang Ting/0000-0001-6622-8313; Wei, Pai-Chun/0000-0003-2225-7280; Ajia, Idris/0000-0003-3156-4426k King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research [OSR-2016-CRG5-3005]; KAUST solar center [FCC/1/3079-08-01]; KAUST baseline funding; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Electronic Materials Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1201]∆í King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology); KAUST solar center; KAUST baseline funding; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Electronic Materials Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√¶ This work was financially supported by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR-2016-CRG5-3005), KAUST solar center (FCC/1/3079-08-01), and KAUST baseline funding.

Here, we demonstrate a strategy to fabricate compartmentalized systems in 3D water-in-water constructs stabilized by an elastic polyanion-polycation coacervate membrane. Using a 3D printer, the length, shape, and diameter of all-aqueous tubules are broadly controlled. We demonstrate directional diffusion of ionic species across the membrane dictated by the preferential affinity of the polyelectrolyte in the oppositely charged phase. In conjunction with microfluidic techniques, continuous selective diffusion and compartmentalized reactions are demonstrated in such all-aqueous systems. A layer-by-layer strategy is also used to tune the membrane's mechanical properties and to functionalize them. Such a new platform is demonstrated for developing and manipulating continuous separations media or compartmentalized reactive systems that function independently or can be coupled with selective diffusion across the membrane.‚Äù [Xie, Ganhua; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Xie, Ganhua; Forth, Joe; Ashby, Paul D.; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu; Ashby, Paul D.; Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beiling Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, WPI, AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japank University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Tohoku University√ê Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beiling Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, WPI, AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.f  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321; Forth, Joe/0000-0001-7263-6364 The design, characterization, analysis, and interpretation of the 3D printing experiments were supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

However, the dynamics of individual AgCl nanoparticle motion in liquids upon illumination remains elusive. Here, using liquid cell transmission electron microscope (TEM), AgCl nanocrystals reshaping and splitting spontaneously in an aqueous solution under electron beam illumination are observed. It is found that the AgCl nanocrystals are negatively charged in the liquid environment, where the charge induces a repulsive Coulomb force that reshapes and stretches those nanocrystals. Upon extensive stretching, the AgCl nanocrystal splits into small nanocrystals and each nanocrystal retracts back into cuboid shapes due to the cohesive surface. This analysis shows that each nanocrystal maintains a single crystal rocksalt structure during splitting. The splitting of AgCl nanocrystals is analogous to the electrified liquid droplets or other reported the Coulomb fission phenomenon, but with distinctive structural properties. Revealing of the dynamic behavior of AgCl nanocrystals opens the opportunity to explore their potential applications as actuators for nanodevices.√Ö [Tian, Xuezeng; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tian, Xuezeng; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tian, Xuezeng; Zheng, Haimei] Berkeley Educ Alliance Res Singapore, Singapore 138602, Singapore; [Anand, Utkarsh; Mirsaidov, Utkur] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr BioImaging Sci, Singapore 117557, Singapore; [Anand, Utkarsh; Mirsaidov, Utkur] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117551, Singapore; [Anand, Utkarsh; Mirsaidov, Utkur] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Adv Mat 2D, Singapore 117546, Singapore; [Anand, Utkarsh; Mirsaidov, Utkur] Natl Univ Singapore, Graphene Res Ctr, Singapore 117546, Singapore United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore+ Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Berkeley Educ Alliance Res Singapore, Singapore 138602, Singapore.S  Tian, Xuezeng/F-7845-2010; Mirsaidov, Utkur/A-6552-2012; Anand, Utkarsh/S-5542-2018≈Ω  Mirsaidov, Utkur/0000-0001-8673-466X; Tian, Xuezeng/0000-0002-4563-1960; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Anand, Utkarsh/0000-0003-3914-8435C U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC22ZH]; SinBeRise program of Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore (BEARS); Singapore Ministry of Education under Academic Research Fund Tier 2 [MOE2016-T2-2-009]_ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); SinBeRise program of Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore (BEARS); Singapore Ministry of Education under Academic Research Fund Tier 2(Ministry of Education, Singapore)? This work was funded by U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the in situ TEM program (KC22ZH).

However, a key challenge is to directly assemble nanosized building blocks into functional entities with designed morphologies. For example, the DNA templated nanoparticle assembly has low scalability and requires aqueous conditions, while other approaches such as controlled drying and polymer templating access only simple 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D structures with limited assembly patterns. Here, we demonstrate a new self-assembly strategy that expands the diversity of 3-D nanoparticle assemblies. By subjecting supramolecular nanocomposites to cylindrical confinement, a range of new nanoparticle assemblies such as stacked rings and single and double helices can be readily obtained with a precisely defined morphology. Circular dichroism dark field scattering measurements on the single nanowire with Au helical ribbon-like assembly show chiral plasmonic response several orders of magnitude higher than that of natural chiral materials. The phase behavior of supramolecular nanocomposite under geometric constraints is quite different from that of block copolymer. It depends on the complex interplay among nanoparticle packing and phase behavior of parent block copolymers under confinement and can be governed by nanoparticle diffusion.¬£ [Bai, Peter; Bao, Wei; Kao, Joseph; Thorkelsson, Kari; Salmeron, Miquel; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yang, Sui; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bao, Wei; Salmeron, Miquel; Zhang, Xiang; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.H  Yang, Sui/H-4417-2016; Zhang, Xiang/F-6905-2011; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019d  Zhang, Xiang/0000-0002-3272-894X; Bao, Wei/0000-0003-2974-2625; Salmeron, Miquel/0000-0002-2887-8128¬´ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC3104]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division of the US Department of Energy within the Metamaterials Program [KC12XZ]√∞ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division of the US Department of Energy within the Metamaterials Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬∏ This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

The POM/beta-CD hybrid can be dispersed in water and interacts at a water/oil interface with ligands dissolved in an oil phase through electrostatic or host-guest interactions, thereby generating POM-surfactants (POMSs) having pH, redox, and guest-competitive responsiveness, respectively. By taking advantage of the jamming of POMSs at the interface, a reconfigurable all-liquid system could be produced that is responsive to orthogonal changes in the external environment.o [Xia, Zhiqin; Lin, Chang-Gen; Yang, Yang; Wang, Yongkang; Song, Yu-Fei; Shi, Shaowei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zhanpeng] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Lin, Chang-Gen; Song, Yu-Fei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Chem Resource Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory√± Song, YF; Shi, SW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Song, YF (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Chem Resource Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.K  songyf@mail.buct.edu.cn; russell@mail.pse.umass.edu; shisw@mail.buct.edu.cn   Shi, Shaowei/0000-0002-9869-4340 National Natural Science Foundation of China [52173018, 51903011]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [2222071]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]¬® This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52173018, 51903011) and Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2222071).

However, owing to the highly hydrophilic nature of MXene nanosheets, assembly strategies of MXene at liquid-liquid interfaces have been very limited and challenging. Herein, through the cooperative assembly of MXene and amine-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane at the oil-water interface, we report the formation, assembly, and jamming of a new type MXene-based Janus-like nanoparticle surfactants, termed MXene-surfactants (MXSs), which can significantly enhance the interfacial activity of MXene nanosheets. More importantly, this simple assembly strategy opens a new platform for the fabrication of functional MXene assemblies from mesoscale (e.g., structured liquids) to macroscale (e.g., aerogels), that can be used for a range of applications, including nanocomposites, electronic devices, and all-liquid microfluidic devices. [Shi, Shaowei; Qian, Bingqing; Sun, Huilou; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xinyu; Wang, Haiqiao; Zhang, Hao-Bin; Yu, Zhong-Zhen] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√≤ Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Zhang, HB (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.P  shisw@mail.buct.edu.cn; zhanghaobin@mail.buct.edu.cn; russell@mail.pse.umass.eduZ  zhang, hao-bin/Y-9093-2018; Yu, Zhong-Zhen/M-2252-2018; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022‚Äô  zhang, hao-bin/0000-0003-1156-0495; Yu, Zhong-Zhen/0000-0001-8357-3362; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Shi, Shaowei/0000-0002-9869-4340 National Natural Science Foundation of China [51903011, 51922020]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [2194083]; Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]J National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬ß This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51903011, 51922020), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2194083).

For example, graphene has been used as the electron transparent membrane for liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM) due to its high mechanical strength and flexibility, single-atom thickness, chemical inertness, etc. Here, we report using 2D MoS2 as a functional substrate as well as the membrane window for liquid cell TEM, which is enabled by our facile and polymer-free MoS2 transfer process. This provides the opportunity to investigate the growth of Pt nanocrystals on MoS2 substrates, which elucidates the formation mechanisms of such heterostructured 2D materials. We find that Pt nanocrystals formed in MoS2 liquid cells have a strong tendency to align their crystal lattice with that of MoS2, suggesting a van der Waals epitaxial relationship. Importantly, we can study its impact on the kinetics of the nanocrystal formation. The development of MoS2 liquid cells will allow further study of various liquid phenomena on MoS2, and the polymer-free MoS2 transfer process will be implemented in a wide range of applications. [Yang, Jiwoong; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Choi, Moon Kee; Lee, Seung-Wuk] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Choi, Moon Kee; Lee, Seung-Wuk] Univ Calif Berkeley, Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Choi, Moon Kee; Lee, Seung-Wuk] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Biol Syst & Engn Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sheng, Yuewen; Chen, Tongxin; Warner, Jamie H.] Univ Oxford, Dept Mat, 16 Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PH, England; [Jung, Jaebong; Kim, Ji Hoon] Pusan Natl Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Bustillo, Karen; Ercius, Peter; Chan, Emory M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√Æ United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Oxford; Pusan National University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California BerkeleyW  Lee, Seung-Wuk/AAS-3031-2020; Choi, Moon Kee/GWQ-5703-2022; Ercius, Peter/AAN-2870-2020¬Æ  Choi, Moon Kee/0000-0003-4536-3393; Ercius, Peter/0000-0002-6762-9976; Warner, Jamie/0000-0002-1271-2019; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Sheng, Yuewen/0000-0003-3067-9520√ï U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under the insitu TEM program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC22ZH]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2015R1C1A1A01051620]; Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Institute Fund√£ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under the insitu TEM program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT; Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Institute Fund≈∏ This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 within the insitu TEM program (KC22ZH).

Such corrections are commonly used to improve the accuracy of computational enthalpies of formation, phase stability predictions, and other energy-derived properties, for example. We incorporate this method into a new DFT energy correction scheme comprising a mixture of oxidation-state and composition-dependent corrections and show that many chemical systems contain unstable polymorphs that may actually be predicted stable when uncertainty is taken into account. We then illustrate how these uncertainties can be used to estimate the probability that a compound is stable on a compositional phase diagram, thus enabling better-informed assessments of compound stability.  [Wang, Amanda; Kingsbury, Ryan; McDermott, Matthew; Horton, Matthew; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [McDermott, Matthew; Horton, Matthew; Jain, Anubhav; Ong, Shyue Ping; Dwaraknath, Shyam; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ong, Shyue Ping] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA) University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California San Diego; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryO Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.D  Ong, Shyue Ping/AAY-1642-2021; Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020h  Ong, Shyue Ping/0000-0001-5726-2587; Jain, Anubhav/0000-0001-5893-9967; Wang, Amanda/0000-0002-5084-4039( U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]; Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBS) Local Spectroscopy Data Infrastructure (LSDI) project - National Science Foundation (NSF) [1640899]+ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBS) Local Spectroscopy Data Infrastructure (LSDI) project - National Science Foundation (NSF)¬£ This work was intellectually led by the Materials Project, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231: Materials Project Program KC23MP.

When a dispersion of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) in an aqueous solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) is brought into contact with chitosan dissolved in an aqueous solution of dextran, the CNCs and chitosan diffuse to the interface between the two immiscible aqueous solutions, electrostatically interact, and form a solid, membranous layer sufficiently rapidly to 3D print tubules of one liquid in the other. The diameter, length, spatial arrangement, and stability of the printed tubules can be broadly controlled. Adsorption and directional diffusion of ionic species across the membranous layer make heavy metal ion removal possible. The results present a platform for fabricating and developing all-aqueous compartmentalized systems where function can be independently coupled to the inherent functionality of the nanoparticles or ligands.c [Lin, Dandan; Liu, Tan; Yuan, Qingqing; Yang, Hongkun; Ma, Hongyang; Shi, Shaowei; Wang, Dong; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Lin, Dandan; Liu, Tan; Yuan, Qingqing; Yang, Hongkun; Ma, Hongyang; Shi, Shaowei; Wang, Dong; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA Shi, SW; Wang, D; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Shi, SW; Wang, D; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.Y  Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; Lin, Dandan/GRJ-2233-2022; Ma, Hongyang/AAT-7857-2021 National Natural Science Foundation of China [51673016, 51903011]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Army Research Office [W911NF-17-1-0003] National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Army Research Office This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51673016 and 51903011).

However, the relationship between a multicomponent nanocomposite's formulation and its assembled structure is complex and cannot be predicted by theory. The blends can be strongly influenced by processing conditions, which can introduce non-equilibrium states. Currently, nanocomposite devices are designed through cycles of experimental trial and error. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative because they can use existing datasets to map high-dimensional spaces. These methods do not rely on known relationships between parameters, so they are suited to complex systems without a solid theoretical foundation. Here, a dataset of 595 microscopy images of nanocomposite thin films is used to train a series of ML models. Correlations between the input and output parameters are examined, providing new insights into the system. Finally, the most successful ML model is used to predict the structures of new nanocomposite compositions. The results confirm that ML techniques can be used to improve the efficiency of nanocomposite device design. More broadly, the current study suggests some of the advantages and challenges associated with applying ML to complex systems.∆í [Vargo, Emma; Alivisatos, Paul; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Vargo, Emma; Dahl, Jakob C.; Evans, Katherine M.; Alivisatos, Paul; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dahl, Jakob C.; Evans, Katherine M.; Khan, Tasneem; Alivisatos, Paul; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAc  Vargo, Emma/0000-0003-2624-8381; Khan, Tasneem/0000-0003-3684-0231; Dahl, Jakob/0000-0002-1443-8877¬ù U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]; Department of Defense through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program; National Science Foundation [DGE 1752814]; Kavli NanoScience Institute, University of California, Berkeley through the Philomathia Graduate Student Fellowship√† U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Department of Defense through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Kavli NanoScience Institute, University of California, Berkeley through the Philomathia Graduate Student Fellowship(University of California System)‚Äì E.V., J.C.D., and K.M.E. contributed equally to this work.

A lot of focus has been on maximizing the radiative cooling power of roof coating in the hot daytime using static, cooling-optimized material properties. However, the resultant overcooling in cold night or winter times exacerbates the heating cost, especially in climates where heating dominates energy consumption. We approached thermal regulation from an all-season perspective by developing a mechanically flexible coating that adapts its thermal emittance to different ambient temperatures. The fabricated temperature-adaptive radiative coating (TARC) optimally absorbs the solar energy and automatically switches thermal emittance from 0.20 for ambient temperatures lower than 15 degrees C to 0.90 for temperatures above 30 degrees C, driven by a photonically amplified metal-insulator transition. Simulations show that this system outperforms existing roof coatings for energy saving in most climates, especially those with substantial seasonal variations. [Tang, Kechao; Dong, Kaichen; Wang, Qingjun; Lin, Chang-Yu; Yao, Jie; Wu, Junqiao] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tang, Kechao; Dong, Kaichen; Li, Jiachen; Kim, Hyungjin; Wang, Qingjun; Javey, Ali; Yao, Jie; Wu, Junqiao] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tang, Kechao] Peking Univ, Sch Integrated Circuits, Key Lab Microelect Devices & Circuits MOE, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiachen; Gordon, Madeleine P.; Wu, Junqiao] Univ Calif Berkeley, Appl Sci & Technol Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gordon, Madeleine P.; Urban, Jeffrey J.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Reichertz, Finnegan G.] East Bay Innovat Acad, 3800 Mt Blvd, Oakland, CA 94619 USA; [Kim, Hyungjin; Javey, Ali] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rho, Yoonsoo; Grigoropoulos, Costas P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Levinson, Ronnen] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Heat Isl Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Peking University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) Wu, JQ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wu, JQ (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wu, JQ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Appl Sci & Technol Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  wuj@berkeley.edu/  Javey, Ali/B-4818-2013; Wu, Junqiao/G-7840-2011√é  Javey, Ali/0000-0001-7214-7931; Wu, Junqiao/0000-0002-1498-0148; Li, Jiachen/0000-0002-0368-3551; Reichertz, Finnegan/0000-0002-5203-8698; Rho, Yoonsoo/0000-0003-2870-5064; Lin, Chang-Yu/0000-0001-8427-6626≈í Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC1201]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Building Technologies Office, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation [1555336]; National Science Foundation Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Building Technologies Office, of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation(Nation<    al Science Foundation (NSF))d This work was funded by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, US Department of Energy, under contract no.

The ability to predict NMR parameters and connect them to three-dimensional local environments is critical for understanding more complex, long-range interactions. New computational methods have revealed structural information available from Si-29 solid-state NMR by generating computed reference spectra for solids. Such predictions are useful for the identification of new silicon-containing compounds, and serve as a starting point for determination of the local environments present in amorphous structures. In this study, we have used 42 silicon sites as a benchmarking set to compare experimentally reported Si-29 solid-state NMR spectra with those computed by CASTEP-NMR and Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Program (VASP). Data-driven approaches enable us to identify the source of discrepancies across a range of experimental and computational results. The information from NMR (in the form of an NMR tensor) has been validated, and in some cases corrected, in an effort to catalog these for the local spectroscopy database infrastructure (LSDI), where over 10,000 Si-29 NMR tensors for crystalline materials have been computed. Knowledge of specific tensor values can serve as the basis for executing NMR experiments with precision, optimizing conditions to capture the elements accurately. The ability to predict and compare experimental observables from a wide range of structures can aid researchers in their chemical assignments and structure determination, since the computed values enables the extension beyond tables of typical chemical shift (or shielding) ranges. [Sun, He; Hayes, Sophia E.] Washington Univ, Dept Chem, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Dwaraknath, Shyam; Qu, Xiaohui; Huck, Patrick] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ling, Handong; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬≤  Washington University (WUSTL); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley¬Ø  Hayes, SE (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Chem, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Dwaraknath, S (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  shyamd@lbl.gov; hayes@wustl.edu@  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Hayes, Sophia/C-1075-2008ÀÜ  Sun, He/0000-0002-1887-1643; Hayes, Sophia/0000-0002-2809-6193; Huck, Patrick/0000-0001-8237-2227; Dwaraknath, Shyam/0000-0003-0289-2607√ú  U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) [1640899]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]; NSF [ACI-1053575] U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))√ú This work is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), Award 1640899.

We develop a computationally efficient method for calculating carrier scattering rates of solid-state semiconductors and insulators from first principles inputs. The present method extends existing polar and non-polar electron-phonon coupling, ionized impurity, and piezoelectric scattering mechanisms formulated for isotropic band structures to support highly anisotropic materials. We test the formalism by calculating the electronic transport properties of 23 semiconductors, including the large 48 atom CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid perovskite, and comparing the results against experimental measurements and more detailed scattering simulations. The Spearman rank coefficient of mobility against experiment (r(s)=0.93) improves significantly on results obtained using a constant relaxation time approximation (r(s)=0.52). We find our approach offers similar accuracy to state-of-the art methods at approximately 1/500th the computational cost, thus enabling its use in high-throughput computational workflows for the accurate screening of carrier mobilities, lifetimes, and thermoelectric power. It is difficult to compute the transport properties of a broad array of complex materials both accurately and inexpensively. Here, the authors develop a computationally efficient method for calculating carrier scattering rates of semiconductors, with good accuracy but low cost.√Ä [Ganose, Alex M.; Park, Junsoo; Faghaninia, Alireza; Woods-Robinson, Rachel; Jain, Anubhav] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Woods-Robinson, Rachel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Appl Sci & Technol Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Energy Sci Area, Berkeley, CA USA( United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryt  Ganose, AM; Jain, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  aganose@lbl.gov; ajain@lbl.gov<   A  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Ganose, Alex/AAS-3452-2020C  Ganose, Alex/0000-0002-4486-3321; Jain, Anubhav/0000-0001-5893-9967[ U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Early Career Research Program; DOE Basic Energy Sciences program - the Materials Project [KC23MP]; National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE1106400, DGE175814]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DEAC02-05CH11231]; DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√û U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Early Career Research Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Basic Energy Sciences program - the Materials Project(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))h This work was intellectually led and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Early Career Research Program.

By designing a simplified NPS model, where the NP size can be precisely controlled and the characteristic fluorescence of the NPs be used as a direct probe of their spatial distribution, we provide new insights into the attachment mechanism of NPSs at the liquid-liquid interface. We find that the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be reduced by competitive ligands, resulting in the dissociation and disassembly of NPSs at the interface, and allowing the construction of responsive, reconfigurable all-liquid systems. Smaller NPSs that are loosely packed (unjammed) and irreversibly bound to the interface can be displaced by larger NPSs, giving rise to a size-dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface. However, when the smaller size NPSs are densely packed and jam at the interface, the size-dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface can be completely suppressed. [Wang, Beibei; Yin, Bangqi; Zhang, Zhao; Yin, Yixuan; Yang, Yang; Shi, Shaowei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haiqiao; Shi, Shaowei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Synth & Applicat Waterborne, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA. Shi, SW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Shi, SW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Synth & Applicat Waterborne, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.g  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Yin, Qi/0000-0001-5067-2372; Shi, Shaowei/0000-0002-9869-4340/ Beijing Natural Science Foundation [2222071]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52173018, 51903011]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Army Research Office [W911NF-20-0093]e Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Army Research Office√™ This work was supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2222071) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52173018, 51903011).

However, multicomponent systems, such as nanocomposites, have complex phase diagrams and kinetic pathways. Here, effects of two critical parameters, nanoparticle (NP) size and supramolecular morphology, were systematically evaluated in NP/supramolecule blends. NPs in the size range of 5-25 nm were assembled in cylindrical or lamellar supramolecular nanocomposite thin films with periodicities of 20-30 nm under solvent vapor annealing and rapid solvent removal conditions. The ratio of particle size to supramolecular periodicity was tuned between 0.17 and 1.25. The results showed that the vertical diffusion of NPs toward the film surface depends on the matrix morphology. NP surface migration is more prominent in cylindrical thin films than in lamellar thin films. This is mainly attributed to the higher energetic barriers for interdomain diffusion in lamellar morphology. Supramolecular nancomposite thin films with ordered structures can be obtained by balancing the size-dependent NP diffusivity and energetic factors affecting NP diffusion during the annealing process for a range of NP sizes.

These configurations have been stabilized in solid-state materials with a global inversion symmetry breaking, which translates in magnetic materials into a vector spin exchange known as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), as well as spin chirality selection and isotropic solitons. This work reports experimental evidence of 3D chiral spin textures, such as helical spins and skyrmions with different chirality and topological charge, stabilized in amorphous Fe-Ge thick films. These results demonstrate that structurally and chemically disordered materials with a random DMI can resemble inversion symmetry broken systems with similar magnetic properties, moments, and states. Disordered systems are distinguished from systems with global inversion symmetry breaking by their degenerate spin chirality that allows for forming isotropic and anisotropic topological spin textures at remanence, while offering greater flexibility in materials synthesis, voltage, and strain manipulation.‚Äô [Streubel, Robert] Univ Nebraska, Dept Phys & Astron, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Streubel, Robert] Univ Nebraska, Nebraska Ctr Mat & Nanosci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Streubel, Robert; Bouma, D.

Here, we describe an emulsion-based ink for direct printing using 2D nanomaterials, i.e., MXene and graphene oxide (GO). The electrostatic interactions between the ligands in the oil phase and the 2D nanomaterials in the aqueous phase help form sheet-like surfactants at the interface. The interactions between the anchored ligands among different droplets dictate the rheological characteristics of inks, enabling a gel-like behavior ideally suitable for 3D printing at ultralow concentrations of 2D nanomaterials. The 3D printed foams possess lightweight structures with densities of 2.8 mg cm-3 (GO-based) and 4.1 mg cm-3 (MXene-based), and the latter integrates outstanding electrical conductivity, electromagnetic shielding performance, and thermal insulation comparable to air. This work describes a general approach for direct-printing ultralight porous structures that take advantage of the inherent properties of 2D building blocks.% [Li, Lulu; Deng, Zhiming; Chen, Mengjie; Yu, Zhong-Zhen; Zhang, Hao-Bin] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhong-Zhen; Zhang, Hao-Bin] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Key Lab Adv Funct Polymer Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing<     Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China√à  Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology Zhang, HB (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Organ Inorgan Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Zhang, HB (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Key Lab Adv Funct Polymer Composites, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.3  russell@mail.pse.umass.edu; zhanghaobin@buct.edu.cn5  zhang, haobin/Y-9093-2018; Yu, Zhong-Zhen/M-2252-2018E  zhang, haobin/0000-0003-1156-0495; Yu, Zhong-Zhen/0000-0001-8357-3362¬π National Natural Science Foundation of China [51922020, 52273064, 52090034]; open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Organic - Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology [OIC-202201001]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]√å National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Organic - Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))& Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51922020, 52273064, 52090034) and the open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Organic - Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology (OIC-202201001) is gratefully acknowledged.

By taking advantage of the electrostatic interactions between water-soluble molecular brushes and oil-soluble oligomeric ligands, the in situ formation, assembly and jamming of molecular brush surfactants (MBSs) at the oil-water interface is described. With MBSs, stable emulsions including o/w, w/o and o/w/o can be easily prepared by varying the molar ratios of the molecular brushes to the ligands. Moreover, when jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, i.e., structuring liquids, producing an elastic film at the interface with exceptional mechanical properties. These structured liquids have numerous potential applications, including chemical biphasic reactions, liquid electronics, and all-liquid biomimetic system.≈† [Wang, Beibei; Liu, Tan; Chen, Hao; Yin, Bangqi; Zhang, Zhao; Shi, Shaowei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬†  Shi, SW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.' National Natural Science Foundation of China [51903011]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [2194083]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Army Research Office [W911NF-17-1-0003]√ü This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51903011) and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2194083).

However, the multicomponent supramolecular system is complex, and there is a limited understanding of the self-assembly process which is critical for precise control of the nanostructure. Here, the effect of small molecule loading and the solvent annealing condition on thin films of supramolecules on flat and patterned substrates were investigated. There is a superposition between the effect of the small molecule loading and solvent annealing condition that can be used to control the assembly rate, grain size, and feature size. The final film features are a result of the kinetic pathway taken during the assembly process. On patterned substrates with linear or circular trenches, the assembly is not driven by incommensurability as is commonly seen in BCP thin films but rather by the kinetic pathway. The present study offers insight into the importance of systematic studies in the kinetic process in self-assembly of multicomponent systems.√¨  [Evans, Katherine; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ó  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.c U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH1135]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]¬ù U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences,<     of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))] This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (Organic Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104).

Controlling surface tension in this manner is necessary for predation, escape and survival. Inspired by this behaviour, we demonstrate autonomous, aqueous-based synthetic systems that overcome the meniscus barrier and shuttle cargo subsurface to and from a landing site and a targeted drop-off site. We change the sign of the contact angle of a coacervate sac containing an aqueous phase or of a hydrogel droplet hanging from the surface by controlling the normal force acting on the sac or droplet. The cyclic buoyancy-induced cargo shuttling occurs continuously, as long as the supply of reactants diffusing to the sac or droplet from the surrounding aqueous phase is not exhausted. These findings may lead to potential applications in autonomously driven reaction or delivery systems and micro-/milli-robotics.√ó [Xie, Ganhua; Li, Pei; Kim, Paul Y.; Gu, Pei-Yang; Helms, Brett A.; Ashby, Paul D.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Pei; Jiang, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Tech Inst Phys & Chem, Key Lab Bioinspired Mat & Interfacial Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gu, Pei-Yang] Soochow Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Helms, Brett A.; Ashby, Paul D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, WPI Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Sendai, Miyagi, Japanf United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Technical Institute of Physics & Chemistry, CAS; Soochow University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Tohoku UniversityJ Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, WPI Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.V  Kim, Paul/GYV-3258-2022; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; gu, peiyang/HJH-4059-2023≈†  Kim, Paul/0000-0003-0943-4924; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Helms, Brett/0000-0003-3925-4174; Ashby, Paul/0000-0003-4195-310Xt US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Army Research Office [W911NF-20-0093]‚Ä¶ US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Army Research Office¬ø The design, characterization, and analysis of the hanging droplets experiments were supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract number DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16) (G.X., P.Y.K., B.A.H., P.D.A. and T.P.R.).

Here, we have developed blends of carbon black and the commercially available triblock copolymer (BCP), polystyrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene)-g-maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MAH) (FG1924G, Kraton), that can be readily applied as a conductive coating via a spray-coating process, for a wide range of insulating materials (fabric, wood, glass, and plastic). Simple but effective mechanical and chemical modifications of the ingredients can increase the electrical conductivity (similar to 100 S/m) by an order of magnitude more than previously reported for carbon black composites; moreover, the coatings display excellent mechanical flexibility (tensile strain epsilon similar to 5.00 mm/mm). To correlate electrical conductivity and nanoscale structural changes with mechanical deformation, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) during in situ tensile testing was performed. We show that the nanocomposite can be produced using low-cost ingredients (similar to$ 10/kg), ensuring scalability for fabrication of large-scale devices without specialized material synthesis. Equally important, the phase behavior of block copolymers can enable recovery from physical damage via thermal annealing, which is critical for product longevity. [Kwon, Junpyo; Evans, Katherine; Ma, Le; Ritchie, Robert O.; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Evans, Katherine; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ma, Le; Ritchie, Robert O.; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kwon, Junpyo; Yildizdag, M.

The extent to which the polymer chains can deform influences the packing density of the JNPs at the interface. The longer the polymer chains are relative to the core, the softer are the JNPs, resulting in a JNPs assembly with a lower initial lateral packing density. The interfacial activity of JNPs can be further tuned by complexation of the PMMA chains with lithium ions that are introduced into the water phase. This work provides a fundamental understanding of soft JNPs packing at the water-oil interface and provides a strategy to tailor the areal density of soft JNPs at liquid-liquid interface, enabling the design of smart responsive structured-liquid systems.√¥ [Jiang, Yufeng; Gu, Peiyang; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jiang, Yufeng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Appl Sci & Technol, 210 Hearst Mem Min Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chakroun, Ramzi; Groeschel, Andre H.] Univ Munster, Phys Chem, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Chakroun, Ramzi; Groeschel, Andre H.] Univ Munster, Ctr Soft Nanosci SoN, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, JapanH United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Munster; University of Munster; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Tohoku University√¨ Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.=  Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; gu, peiyang/HJH-4059-2023K  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Jiang, Yufeng/0000-0002-1705-5863< Army Research Office [W911NF-17-1-0003]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [376920678]L Army Research Office; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))f This work was supported in part by the Army Research Office under contract W911NF-17-1-0003.

Herein, Ta2N3 is directly deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering and its optoelectronic properties are characterized. Combining these results with density functional theory provides insights into the critical role of oxygen in both synthesis and electronic structure. While the inclusion of oxygen in the process gas is critical to Ta2N3 formation, the resulting oxygen incorporation in structural vacancies drastically modifies the free electron concentration in the as-grown material, thus leading to a semiconducting character with a 1.9 eV bandgap. Reducing the oxygen impurity concentration via post-synthetic ammonia annealing increases the conductivity by seven orders of magnitude and yields the metallic characteristics of a degenerate semiconductor, consistent with theoretical predictions. Thus, this inverse oxygen doping approach - by which the carrier concentration is reduced by the oxygen impurity - offers a unique opportunity to tailor the optoelectronic properties of Ta2N3 for applications ranging from photochemical energy conversion to advanced photonics. [Jiang, Chang-Ming; Wagner, Laura I.; Eichhorn, Johanna; Rieth, Tim; Kunzelmann, Viktoria F.; Kraut, Max; Sharp, Ian D.] Tech Univ Munich, Walter Schottky Inst & Phys Dept, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Horton, Matthew K.; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Horton, Matthew K.; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, B<    erkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Yanbo] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Inst Fundamental & Frontier Sci, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China√´  Technical University of Munich; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Electronic Science & Technology of Chinap  Sharp, ID (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Walter Schottky Inst & Phys Dept, D-85748 Garching, Germany.  sharp@wsi.tum.dem  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Li, Yanbo/A-3461-2009; Li, Yanbo/ABG-9842-2021; Sharp, Ian/I-6163-2015 Li, Yanbo/0000-0002-3017-762X; Li, Yanbo/0000-0002-3017-762X; Kunzelmann, Viktoria/0000-0002-4225-0476; Wagner, Laura I./0000-0001-5091-0748; Sharp, Ian/0000-0001-5238-7487; Kraut, Max/0000-0002-7274-4856; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Eichhorn, Johanna/0000-0003-2413-6079Z European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [864234]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [428591260]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]‚Ä¢ European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))‚Ä† This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 864234).

Quantitative investigations into reactions with fast kinetics and/or multiple reagents will benefit from further advances in liquid cell design that facilitate rapidin situmixing and precise control over reagent volumes and concentrations. This work reports the development of inorganic-organic nanocapsules for high-resolution TEM imaging of nanoscale reactions in liquids with well-defined zeptoliter volumes. These hybrid nanocapsules, with 48 nm average diameter, consist of a thin layer of gold coating a lipid vesicle. As a model reaction, the nucleation, growth, and diffusion of nanobubbles generated by the radiolysis of water is investigated inside the nanocapsules. When the nanobubbles are sufficiently small (10-25 nm diameter), they are mobile in the nanocapsules, but their movement deviates from Brownian motion, which may result from geometric confinement by the nanocapsules. Gases and fluids can be transported between two nanocapsules when they fuse, demonstratingin situmixing without using complex microfluidic schemes. The ability to synthesize nanocapsules with controlled sizes and to monitor dynamics simultaneously inside multiple nanocapsules provides opportunities to investigate nanoscale processes such as single nanoparticle synthesis in confined volumes and biological processes such as biomineralization and membrane dynamics.¬ª [Alam, Sardar B.; Bustillo, Karen C.; Ophus, Colin; Ercius, Peter; Chan, Emory M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Alam, Sardar B.; Yang, Jiwoong; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yang, Jiwoong] Daegu Gyeongbuk Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Energy Sci & Engn, Daegu 72988, South Korea United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology (DGIST)( Chan, EM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.   hmzhengd@lbl.gov; emchan@lbl.gov=  Ercius, Peter/AAN-2870-2020; Alam, Sardar Bilal/ABG-5910-2020¬Ø  Ercius, Peter/0000-0002-6762-9976; Chan, Emory/0000-0002-5655-0146; Alam, Sardar Bilal/0000-0002-3906-2837; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Ophus, Colin/0000-0003-2348-8558  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the in situ TEM program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC22ZH]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]C U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the in situ TEM program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))' This work was funded by U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the in situ TEM program (KC22ZH).

The dynamics of the interfacial assembly is measured while the interface saturates with NPs. Weak attractions between NPs lead to gel-like structures in the assembly, where the in-plane ordering is inhibited by the broad size distribution of the NPs. Structural rearrangements on the length scale of the NP-NP center-to-center distances proceed by intermittent fluctuations instead of continuous cooperative motions. The coexistence of rapid and slow NP populations is confirmed, as commonly observed in soft glass-forming materials. Dynamics are increasingly slowed as the NPs initially segregate to the locally clustered interface. The structural relax<    ation of the NPs in these localized clusters is 5 orders of magnitude slower than that of free particles in the bulk. When the interface is nearly saturated, the time for relaxation increases suddenly due to the onset of local jamming, and the dynamics slow exponentially afterward until the system reaches collective jamming by cooperative rearrangements. This investigation provides insights into structural relaxations near the glass transition and the evolution of the structure and dynamics of the assemblies as they transition from an isotropic liquid to a dense disordered film.¬ù [Kim, Paul Y.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fink, Zachary; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Zhang, Qingteng; Dufresne, Eric M.; Narayanan, Suresh] Argonne Natl Lab, Xray Sci Div, Lemont, IL 60439 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan√≤  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; Tohoku University@ Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.4  Kim, Paul/GYV-3258-2022; Zhang, Qingteng/F-9340-2015B  Kim, Paul/0000-0003-0943-4924; Zhang, Qingteng/0000-0002-1600-2161 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; NSF; DOE SCGSR Program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]‚Äö U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE SCGSR Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√í This work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

Scalable photoelectrocatalysts must satisfy a stringent set of criteria, such as stability under operating conditions, product selectivity, and efficient light absorption. Two-dimensional materials can offer high specific surface area, tunability, and potential for heterostructuring, providing a fresh landscape of candidate catalysts. From a set of promising bulk CO2 reduction photoelectrocatalysts, we screen for candidate monolayers of these materials, then study their catalytic feasibility and suitability. For stable monolayer candidates, we verify the presence of visible-light band gaps, check that band edges can support CO2 reduction, determine exciton binding energies, and compute surface reactivity. We find visible light absorption for SiAs, ZnTe, and ZnSe monolayers, and that due to a lack of binding, CO selectivity is possible. We thus identify SiAs, ZnTe, and ZnSe monolayers as targets for further investigation, expanding the chemical space for CO2 photoreduction candidates. [Torrisi, Steven B.] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Torrisi, Steven B.; Montoya, Joseph H.; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Singh, Arunima K.; Biswas, Tathagata] Arizona State Univ, Dept Phys, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Singh, Arunima K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Chem Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Montoya, Joseph H.] Toyota Res Inst, Los Altos, CA 94022 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAL Harvard University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Toyota Motor Corporation; University of California System; University of California Berkeley5 Torrisi, SB (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Torrisi, SB; Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.(  torrisi@g.harvard.edu; kapersson@lbl.govF  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Biswas, Tathagata/AGJ-7454-2022K  Singh, Arunima/0000-0002-7212-6310; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509√ø Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a DOE Energy Innovation Hub through the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0004993]; DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC23MP]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; San Diego Supercomputer Center under the XSEDE Award [TG-DMR150006]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1906030]; DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship [DE-FG02-97ER25308]Z Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a DOE Energy Innovation Hub through the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); San Diego Supercomputer Center under the XSEDE Award; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√ú Work on the photocatalyst screening was primarily funded by the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a DOE Energy Innovation Hub, supported through the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Award Number DE-SC0004993.

However, accurate treatment of materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (such as many topological materials of recent interest, and thermoelectrics) often requires a nonperturbative approach using spinor wave functions in the Kohn-Sham equation and GW/BSE. Such calculations have only recently become available, in particular for the BSE. We have implemented this approach in the plane-wave pseudopotential GW/BSE code BerkeleyGW, which is highly parallelized and widely used in the electronic-structure community. We present reference results for quasiparticle band structures and optical absorption spectra of solids with different strengths of spin-orbit coupling, including Si, Ge, GaAs, GaSb, CdSe, Au, and Bi2Se3. The calculated quasiparticle band gaps of these systems are found to agree with experiment to within a few tens of meV. SOC splittings are found to be generally in better agreement with experiment, including quasiparticle corrections to band energies. The absorption spectrum of GaAs is not significantly impacted by the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling due to its relatively small value (0.2 eV) in the Lambda direction, while the absorption spectrum of GaSb calculated with the spinor GW/BSE captures the large spin-orbit splitting of peaks in the spectrum. For the prototypical topological insulator Bi2Se3, we find a drastic change in the low-energy band structure compared to that of DFT, with the spinorial treatment of the GW approximation correctly capturing the parabolic nature of the valence and conduction bands after including off-diagonal self-energy matrix elements. We present the detailed methodology, approach to spatial symmetries for spinors, comparison against other codes, and performance compared to spinless GW/BSE calculations and perturbative approaches to SOC. This work aims to spur further development of spinor GW/BSE methodology in excited-state research software and enables a more accurate and detailed exploration of electronic and optical properties of materials containing elements with large atomic numbers. [Barker, Bradford A.; Louie, Steven G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Barker, Bradford A.; Louie, Steven G.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Barker, Bradford A.; Strubbe, David A.] Univ Calif Merced, Dept Phys, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Deslippe, Jack] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Energy Res Sci Comp Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lischner, Johannes] Imperial Coll London, Dept Mat & Phys, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Lischner, Johannes] Imperial Coll London, Thomas Young Ctr Theory & Simulat Mat, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Jain, Manish] Indian Inst Sci, Dept Phys, Ctr Condensed Matter Theory, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Yazyev, Oleg V.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Phys, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland√° University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Merced; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne Barker, BA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Barker, BA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Barker, BA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Merced, Dept Phys, Merced, CA 95343 USA.  bbarker6@ucmerced.edu  /0000-0003-2426-5532 National Science Foundation [DMR10-1006184]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy: by the Director of the Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1203, KC2301]; CTC Program [DE-SC0019053]; CPIMS Program [DE-SC0019053] National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy: by the Director of the Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); CTC Program; CPIMS Program¬∂ The authors would like to thank Felipe H. da Jornada, Derek Vigil-Fowler, Georgy Samsonidze, Gabriel Antonius, Tonatiuh Rangel, and Jeffrey B.

The wrinkling of thin films provides a compelling strategy to achieve this. Despite much attention, however, a simple, single-step, reversible method that gives rise to controlled, two-dimensional (2D) ordered, continuous, and discontinuous patterns has proven to be elusive. Here a novel, robust method is described to achieve this using an ultraviolet-light-sensitive anthracene-containing polymer thin film. The origin of the patterns is the local buckling of the thin film, where the control over the topology is given by laterally patterning out-of-plane gradients in the crosslink density of the film. The underlying buckling mechanics and formation of the surface features are well-described by finite element analysis. By illuminating the film with a photomask, local and long-range patterns that can be both continuous and discontinuous are able to be written. Furthermore, the patterning is fully reversible over multiple cycles. The results demonstrate a simple strategy for erasable storage of information in a surface top<    ography that has applications in memory, anticounterfeiting, and plasmonics.  [Hou, Honghao; Lin, Hongbo; Yin, Jie; Jiang, Xuesong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Met Matrix Composite Mat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Hou, Honghao; Forth, Joe; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hu, Kaiming; Zhang, Wenming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, State Key Lab Mech Syst & Vibrat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA√ñ  Shanghai Jiao Tong University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst√µ Jiang, XS (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Met Matrix Composite Mat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zhang, WM (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, State Key Lab Mech Syst & Vibrat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.E  wenmingz@sjtu.edu.cn; russell@mail.pse.umass.edu; ponygle@sjtu.edu.cnj  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Hou, Honghao/0000-0002-7133-9760; Forth, Joe/0000-0001-7263-6364≈æ National Nature Science Foundation of China [51773144, 21522403]; Shanghai Municipal Government [17JC1400700]; National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [11625208]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16] National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Municipal Government; National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))@ H.H. and K.H. contributed equally to this work.

It is now feasible to carry out high-throughput calculations using more accurate methods, such as meta-GGA DFT; however recomputing an entire database with a higher-fidelity method would not effectively leverage the enormous investment of computational resources embodied in existing (GGA) calculations. Instead, we propose here a general procedure by which higher-fidelity, low-coverage calculations (e.g., meta-GGA calculations for selected chemical systems) can be combined with lower-fidelity, high-coverage calculations (e.g., an existing database of GGA calculations) in a robust and scalable manner. We then use legacy PBE(+U) GGA calculations and new r(2)SCAN meta-GGA calculations from the Materials Project database to demonstrate that our scheme improves solid and aqueous phase stability predictions, and discuss practical considerations for its implementation.‚Ä∞ [Kingsbury, Ryan S.; Rosen, Andrew S.; Gupta, Ayush S.; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kingsbury, Ryan S.; Jain, Anubhav] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rosen, Andrew S.; Munro, Jason M.; Ong, Shyue Ping; Dwaraknath, Shyam; Horton, Matthew K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rosen, Andrew S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Miller Inst Basic Res Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ong, Shyue Ping] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬æ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California San Diego; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  ; Rosen, Andrew/G-2407-2014j  Dwaraknath, Shyam/0000-0003-0289-2607; Rosen, Andrew/0000-0002-0141-7006; Gupta, Ayush/0000-0002-1875-8405| U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]; Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBS) Local Spectroscopy Data Infrastructure (LSDI) project - National Science Foundation (NSF) [1640899]; Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley¬† U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBS) Local Spectroscopy Data Infrastructure (LSDI) project - National Science Foundation (NSF); Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley(University of California System) The authors gratefully acknowledge Stephan Lany (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) for contributing structures in the Zn-Sb-N system, Julia Yang (University of California, Berkeley) for contributing the SnBr<INF>2</INF> structures, and Matthew McDermott (University of California, Berkeley) for helpful discussions regarding construction of phase diagrams with a shifted nitrogen chemical potential.

CDS NANOWIRES; QUANTUM <    DOTS; NANOCRYSTALS; SULFIDE; GROWTH; ION√û Cation exchange (CE) has been recognized as a particularly powerful tool for the synthesis of heterogeneous nanocrystals. At present, CE can be divided into two categories, namely ion solvation-driven CE reaction and thermally activated CE reaction. Here we report an electrically driven CE reaction to prepare individual nanostructures inside a transmission electron microscope. During the process, Cd is eliminated due to Ohmic heating, whereas Cu+ migrates into the crystal driven by the electrical field force. Contrast experiments reveal that the feasibility of electrically driven CE is determined by the structural similarity of the sulfur sublattices between the initial and final phases, and the standard electrode potentials of the active electrodes. Our experimental results demonstrate a strategy for the selective growth of individual nanocrystals and provide crucial insights into understanding of the microscopic pathways leading to the formation of heterogeneous structures.‚Ä∞ [Zhang, Qiubo; Yin, Kuibo; Dong, Hui; Zhou, Yilong; Tan, Xiaodong; Yu, Kaihao; Hu, Xiaohui; Xu, Tao; Zhu, Chao; Xia, Weiwei; Xu, Feng; Sun, Litao] Southeast Univ, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, Minist Educ, SEU FEI Nanopico Ctr,Key Lab MEMS, Nanjing 210018, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiaohui] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sun, Litao] Joint Res Inst Southeast Univ & Monash Univ, Ctr Adv Mat & Manufacture, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China√ä  Southeast University - China; Nanjing Tech University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√Æ Sun, LT (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, Minist Educ, SEU FEI Nanopico Ctr,Key Lab MEMS, Nanjing 210018, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Sun, LT (corresponding author), Joint Res Inst Southeast Univ & Monash Univ, Ctr Adv Mat & Manufacture, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.  hmzheng@lbl.gov; slt@seu.edu.cn\  Yin, Kuibo/G-5812-2011; tan, xiao/GZL-0264-2022; Xu, Tao/N-2539-2013; Sun, Litao/D-4289-2013≈∏  Yin, Kuibo/0000-0001-5268-6807; Xu, Tao/0000-0001-5436-0077; Sun, Litao/0000-0002-2750-5004; Hu, Xiaohui/0000-0001-6346-1419; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170% National Natural Science Foundation of China [51420105003, 61274114, 11327901, 11525415, 11674052, 11604047, 11504046]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2242016K41039, MTEC-2015M03, 2242015KD014, NJ20150026]; DOE BES Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [KC22ZH]2 National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); DOE BES Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬ç This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (numbers 51420105003, 61274114, 11327901, 11525415, 11674052, 11604047 and 11504046) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (numbers 2242016K41039, MTEC-2015M03, 2242015KD014 and NJ20150026).

We show that improved fracture resistance in a steel with an ultrahigh yield strength of nearly 2 gigapascals can be achieved by activating delamination toughening coupled with transformation-induced plasticity. Delamination toughening associated with intensive but controlled cracking at manganese-enriched prior-austenite grain boundaries normal to the primary fracture surface dramatically improves the overall fracture resistance. As a result, fracture under plane-strain conditions is automatically transformed into a series of fracture processes in parallel plane-stress conditions through the thickness. The present high-strength induced multidelamination strategy offers a different pathway to develop engineering materials with ultrahigh strength and superior toughness at economical materials cost.3 [Liu, L.; Wang, Z.; Huang, M.

Paula  Observation of an Orientational Glass in a Superlattice of Elliptically-Faceted CdSe Nanocrystalse  nanocrystals; self-assembled superlattice; cadmium chalcogenide; autocorrelation; orientational glass√∑ Extensive prior work has shown that colloidal inorganic nanocrystals coated with organic ligand shells can behave as artificial atoms and, as such, form superlattices with different crystal structures and packing densities. Although ordered superlattices present a high degree of long-range positional order, the relative crystallographic orientation of the inorganic nanocrystals with respect to each other tends to be random. Recent works have shown that superlattices can achieve orientational alignment through combinations of nanocrystal faceting and ligand modification, as well as selective metal particle attachment to particular facets. These studies have focused on the assembly of high-symmetry nanocrystals, such as cubes and cuboctahedra. Here, we study the assembly of elliptically faceted CdSe/CdS core/shell nanocrystals with one distinctive crystallographic orientation along the major elliptical axis. We show that the nanocrystals form an unexpectedly well-ordered translational superlattice, with a degree of order comparable to that achieved with higher-symmetry nanocrystals. Additionally, we show that, due to the particles' faceted shape, the superlattice is characterized by an orientational glass phase in which only certain orientations are possible due to entropically frustrated crystallization. In this phase, the nanocrystals do not exhibit a local orientational ordering but rather have distinct orientations that emerge at different locations within the same domain. The distinct orientations are a result of a facet-to-facet lock-in mechanism that occurs during the self-assembly process. These facet-to-facet alignments force the nanocrystals to tilt on different lattice planes forming different projections that we termed apparent polydispersity. Our experimental realization of an orientational glass phase for multifaceted semiconducting nanocrystals can be used to investigate how this phase is formed and how it can be utilized for potential optical, electrical, and thermal transport applications. [Abbas, Abdullah S.; Vargo, Emma; Xu, Ting; Alivisatos, A.

The thickness of PE/CNC complex can be effectively adjusted by tuning the osmotic stress imbalance between the two aqueous phases and, during the formation and thickening of PE/CNC complex, individual assemblies can be connected to design hierarchical all-aqueous structures. This new platform affords tremendous potential for engineering biomimetic constructs with advanced functionality, that can be used for chemical separation, delivery, and biphasic cascading reaction vessels.‚Äπ [Yin, Yixuan; Liu, Tan; Wang, Beibei; Yin, Bangqi; Yang, Yang; Shi, Shaowei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA} Shi, SW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.. National Natural Science Foundation of China [52173018, 51903011]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [2194083]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Army Research Office [W911NF-200093]x Y. and T.L. contributed equally to this work.

However, to date, there is no report on the generation of CT complexes at the liquid-liquid interface. Here, by using an electron-deficient acceptor dissolved in water and an electron-rich donor dissolved in oil, we present the in situ formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil-water interface. With time, CTCSs can assemble into higher-order nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties, allowing the stabilization of liquids and offering the possibility to structure liquids into nonequilibrium shapes. Moreover, due to the redox-responsiveness of the electron-deficient acceptor, the association and dissociation of CTCSs can be reversibly manipulated in a redox process, leading to the switchable assembly and disassembly of the resultant constructs.‚Ä° [Sun, Shuyi; Xie, Chenxia; Chen, Jie; Yang, Yang; Li, Hui; Shi, Shaowei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA‚Äû Li, H; Shi, SW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.C  hli@buct.edu.cn; russell@mail.pse.umass.edu; shisw@mail.buct.edu.cn  DEC 6  10.1002/anie.202111252  XE2WD  WOS:000716540800001  Hsu, SW; Xu, T  Hsu, Su-Wen; Xu, Tingv  Tailoring Co-assembly of Nanodiscs and Block Copolymer-Based Supramolecules by Manipulating Interparticle Interactionsb  GOLD NANOPARTICLES; SHAPED NANOPARTICLES; NANORODS; ALIGNMENT; SUPERLATTICES; DISPERSION; LOCATION‚Äû Anisotropic nanoparticles exhibit interesting properties and their controlled assemblies are highly desirable to generate functional materials. Different from their spherical counterparts, the incorporation of anisotropic nanoparticles in nanostructured polymeric matrices such as block copolymer or supramolecules depends not only on the particle/polymer interactions and relative size ratio between the particle and polymer features but also on the interparticle interactions. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by systematically studying the block copolymer based supramolecular nanocomposite containing anisotropic copper sulfide nanodiscs, and evaluate the effect of competition between the ligand polymer interaction and internanodisc interaction on the arrangement and interparticle spacing of nanodiscs once blended with supramolecules. The interdisc interaction was modulated by varying the ligand density and/or the ligand shell thickness on the surface of nanodiscs. Reduction in the interdisc interaction leads to isolated dispersion of nanodiscs in supramolecules. On the other hand, increasing the interdisc interaction results in simultaneous self -assembly of nanodiscs into soft -rod nanoparticles nanodiscs with supramolecules. The length of the soft -rod nanoparticle and the interparticle spacing also shows a strong dependence on the interdisc interaction and can be tailored by adding free small molecules in the supramolecular matrix. These systematic studies provide valuable insights toward relative strength of various interactions that can be readily applied to achieve morphological control in anisotropic particle -containing nanocomposites.√ß  [Hsu, Su-Wen; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA <    95064 USA; [Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 95064 USA; [Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 95064 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 95064 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  Su-Wen, Hsu/A-8992-2019  Su-Wen, Hsu/0000-0001-6553-3201| U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH1135]¬∂ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))V This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

Major advancements have been made in improving the efficiencies and product selectiveness of currently known CO2 reduction electrocatalysts, nonetheless, materials discovery is needed to enable economically viable, industrial-scale CO2 reduction. We report here the largest CO2 photocathode search to date, starting with 68860 candidate materials, using a rational first-principles computation-based screening strategy to evaluate synthesizability, corrosion resistance, visible-light absorption, and compatibility of the electronic structure with fuel synthesis. The results confirm the observation of the literature that few materials meet the stringent CO2 photocathode requirements, with only 52 materials meeting all requirements. The results are well validated with respect to the literature, with 9 of these materials having been studied for CO2 reduction, and the remaining 43 materials are discoveries from our pipeline that merit further investigation.√¶ [Singh, Arunima K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Joint Ctr Artificial Photosynth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Singh, Arunima K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Chem Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Montoya, Joseph H.; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Environm Energy Technol Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gregoire, John M.] CALTECH, Joint Ctr Artificial Photosynth, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAY United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; California Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√ö  Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Environm Energy Technol Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.A  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Gregoire, John/F-8854-2018o  Gregoire, John/0000-0002-2863-5265; Singh, Arunima/0000-0002-7212-6310; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509a Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a US Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Innovation Hub through Office of Science of the DOE [DE-SC0004993]; DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division [KC23MP, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science of the DOE [DE-AC020-5CH11231]; National Science Foundation [ACI-1548562]¬µ Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a US Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Innovation Hub through Office of Science of the DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))¬§ This work was primarily funded by the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a US Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Innovation Hub, supported through the Office of Science of the DOE under Award Number DE-SC0004993.

Heterovalent substitution of Pb2+ by non-toxic metal cations yields the double-perovskite structure, which allows for compositional flexibility. In fact, the compositional space is large, given that multiple cations and halides can be combined, resulting in >10(6) perovskite combinations. A starkly increasing num-ber of stable halide double-perovskite compositions are theoreti-cally predicted. The synthesis, however, lags behind, and many dou-ble perovskites are primarily synthesized as powder samples instead of thin films. The latter, however, are needed for thin-film devices such as solar cells, light-emitting devices, and thin-film tran-sistors. Comparing the synthetic approaches successfully applied to hybrid perovskites to methods used for the fabrication of double perovskites, the latter are clearly in their very infancy. The question is whether solution engineering and compositional modification strategies can be exploited to match the exceptional optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskites. <    This review is motivated by a text mining effort that illustrates not only the prevalence of powder over thin-film synthesis but also the discrepancy between the number of compositions experimentally realized and studied and the many predicted compositions. Here we summarize the synthesis aspects of halide double perovskites, and in particular of thin films, including deposition techniques and synthetic modifications to alter film properties.≈° [Zhao, Yihui; Cruse, Kevin; Abdelsamie, Maged; Ceder, Gerbrand] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cruse, Kevin; Ceder, Gerbrand] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sutter-Fella, Carolin M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Chem Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sutter-Fella, Carolin M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA5 United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory√î  Sutter-Fella, CM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Chem Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Sutter-Fella, CM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  csutterfella@lbl.gov   Cruse, Kevin James/GNW-3953-2022‚Ñ¢  Abdelsamie, Maged/0000-0002-4631-5409; Cruse, Kevin James/0000-0002-0540-4165; Sutter-Fella, Carolin/0000-0002-7769-0869; Zhao, Yihui/0000-0003-4881-4751	 US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Molecular Foundry - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]4 US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Molecular Foundry - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))≈Ω This work was funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (D2S2 program KCD2S2).

Using graphene liquid cell electron microscopy and the controllable, oxidative etching of gold nanocrystals, the effect of different ligands on nanocrystal etching can be tracked with nanometer spatial resolution. The chemical environment of liquids irradiated with high-energy electrons is complex and potentially harsh, yet it is possible to observe clear evidence for differential binding properties of specific ligands to the nanorods' surface. Exchanging CTAB ligands for PEG-alkanethiol ligands causes the nanorods to etch at a different, constant rate while still maintaining their aspect ratio. Adding cysteine ligands that bind preferentially to nanorod tips induces etching predominantly on the sides of the rods. This etching at the sides leads to Rayleigh instabilities and eventually breaks apart the nanorod into two separate nanoparticles. The shape transformation is controlled by the interplay between atom removal and diffusion of surface atoms and ligands. These in situ observations are confirmed with ex situ colloidal etching reactions of gold nanorods in solution. The ability to monitor the effect of ligands on nanocrystal shape transformations will enable future in situ studies of nanocrystals surfaces and ligand binding positions./ [Hauwiller, Matthew R.; Ye, Xingchen; Jones, Matthew R.; Chan, Cindy M.; Calvin, Jason J.; Crook, Michelle F.; Alivisatos, A.

High-entropy alloys are of interest in this regard. Specifically, the single-phase CrMnFeCoNi alloy displays tensile strength levels of similar to 1GPa, excellent ductility (similar to 60-70%) and exceptional fracture toughness (K-JIc>200 MPa root m). Here through the use of in situ straining in an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope, we report on the salient atomistic to micro-scale mechanisms underlying the origin of these properties. We identify a synergy of multiple deformation mechanisms, rarely achieved in metallic alloys, which generates high strength, work hardening and ductility, including the easy motion of Shockley partials, their interactions to form stacking-fault parallelepipeds, and arrest at planar slip bands of undissociated dislocations.

  RESONATORSH The low mass density and high mechanical strength of graphene make it an attractive candidate for suspended-membrane energy transducers. Typically, the membrane size dictates the operational frequency and bandwidth. However, in many cases it would be desirable to both lower the resonance frequency and increase the bandwidth, while maintaining overall membrane size. We employ focused ion beam milling or laser ablation to create kirigami-like modification of suspended pure-graphene membranes ranging in size from microns to millimeters. Kirigami engineering successfully reduces the resonant frequency, increases the displacement amplitude, and broadens the effective bandwidth of the transducer. Our results present a promising route to miniaturized wide-band energy transducers with enhanced operational parameter range and efficiency._ [Dai, Chunhui; Pham, Khanh; McCormick, Brady; Blankenship, Brian W.; Zhao, Wenyu; Zhang, Zuocheng; Crommie, Michael F.; Wang, Feng; Grigoropoulos, Costas P.; Zettl, Alex] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dai, Chunhui; Crommie, Michael F.; Wang, Feng; Zettl, Alex] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dai, Chunhui; Crommie, Michael F.; Wang, Feng; Zettl, Alex] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy Nanosci Inst, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rho, Yoonsoo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Laser Thermal Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAl University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley? Zettl, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zettl, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zettl, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy Nanosci Inst, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.&  Blankenship, Brian/0000-0003-4212-6835¬ù  US Department of Energy [DE-AC02- 05-CH11231, DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; U.S. National Science Foundation [CMMI-2024391]; National Science Foundation [DGE 2146752]√Ü  US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))I We thank Donez Horton -Bailey for technical assistance during the early stages of this work.

Here we discover previously unidentified consequences of band-inversion on the surface electronic structure of the topological insulator Bi2Se3. By performing simultaneous spin, time, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we map the spin-polarized unoccupied electronic structure and identify a surface resonance which is distinct from the topological surface state, yet shares a similar spin-orbital texture with opposite orientation. Its momentum dependence and spin texture imply an intimate connection with the topological surface state. Calculations show these two distinct states can emerge from trivial Rashba-like states that change topology through the spin-orbit-induced band inversion. This work thus provides a compelling view of the coevolution of surface states through a topological phase transition, enabled by the unique capability of directly measuring the spin-polarized unoccupied band structure.L [Jozwiak, Chris; Sobota, Jonathan A.; Hussain, Zahid] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sobota, Jonathan A.; Rotundu, Costel R.; Shen, Zhi-Xun] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford Inst Mat & Energy Sci, 2575 Sand Hill Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Sobota, Jonathan A.; Shen, Zhi-Xun] Stanford Univ, Geballe Lab Adv Mat, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sobota, Jonathan A.; Shen, Zhi-Xun] Stanford Univ, Geballe Lab Adv Mat, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gotlieb, Kenneth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kemper, Alexander F.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Phys, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Kemper, Alexander F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Computat Res Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Birgeneau, Robert J.; Lee, Dung-Hai; Lanzara, Alessandra] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Birgeneau, Robert J.; Lee, Dung-Hai; Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Birgeneau, Robert J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA‚Äπ United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; Stanford University; Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley' Jozwiak, C (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Lanzara, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Lanzara, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.#  CMJozwiak@lbl.gov; ALanzara@lbl.gov‚Äù  Fedorov, Aleksandr/E-8658-2014; Kemper, A.

Recent transmission electron micr<    oscopy (TEM) analyses (Nagao et al., 2012a, 2014a, 2014b, 2014c) of samples lifted from beneath fracture surfaces through focused ion beam machining (FIB) revealed a failure mechanism that can be termed hydrogen-enhanced-plasticity mediated decohesion. Fracture occurs by the synergistic action of the hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity and decohesion. In particular, intergranular cracking takes place by dislocation pile-ups impinging on prior austenite grain boundaries and quasi-cleavage is the case when dislocation pile-ups impinge on block boundaries. These high-angle boundaries, which have already weakened by the presence of hydrogen, debond by the pile-up stresses. The micromechanical model of Novak et al. (2010) is used to quantitatively describe and predict the hydrogen-induced failure of these steels. The model predictions verify that introduction of nanosized (Ti,Mo)C precipitates in the steel microstructure enhances the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. The results are used to discuss microstructural designs that are less susceptible to hydrogen induced failure in systems with fixed hydrogen content (closed systems).

However, It remains a challenging subject encompassing both experimental and modeling hurdles. Successful reports of thermal percolation are exclusively found in high-aspect-ratio, conductive fillers such as graphene, albeit at filler loadings significantly higher than the electrical percolation threshold. This anomaly was attributed to the lower filler-matrix thermal conductivity contrast ratio k(f)/km similar to 10(4) compared to electrical conductivity similar to 10(12)-10(16). In a randomly dispersed composite, the _ effect of a low contrast ratio is further accentuated by uncertainties in the morphology of the percolating network and presence of other phases such as disconnected aggregates and colloidal dispersions. Thus, the general properties of percolating networks are convoluted as they lack a defined structure. In contrast, a prototypical system with controllable nanofiller placement enables the elucidation of structure-property relations such as filler size, loading, and assembly. Using self-assembled nanocomposites with a controlled 1,2,3-dimension nanoparticle (NP) arrangement, we demonstrate that thermal percolation can be achieved in spite of using spherical, nonconductive fillers (k(f)/k(m) similar to 60) at a low volume fraction (9 vol %). We observe that the effects of volume fraction, interfacial thermal resistance, and filler conductivity on thermal conductivity depart from effective medium approximations. Most notably, contrast ratio plays a minor role in thermal percolation above k(f) /k(m) similar to 60-a common range for semiconducting nanoparticles/polymer ratios. Our findings bring new perspectives and insights to thermal percolation in nanocomposites, where the limits in contrast ratio, interfacial thermal conductance, and filler size are established.} [Li, Chen; Dai, Jinghang; Tian, Zhiting] Cornell Univ, Sibley Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Chang, Boyce S.; Huang, Jingyu; He, Mengdi; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Evans, Katherine; Hu, Weili; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√´  Cornell University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawr<    ence Berkeley National Laboratorye Tian, Z (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sibley Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.(  zhiting@cornell.edu; tingxu@berkeley.edu√∑  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC0205-CH11231, KC3104]; NSF CAREER Award [CBET-1839384]; American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund [58688-DNI7]H U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund(American Chemical Society)√Ü This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract DE-AC0205-CH11231 (Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104).

Spherulite structures with radial fibrillar branches have been found in various solids; however, their growth mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report real time imaging of the formation of two-dimensional (2D) iron oxide spherulite nanostructures in a liquid cell using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By tracking the growth trajectories, we show the characteristics of the reaction front and growth kinetics. Our observations reveal that the tip of a growing branch splits as the width exceeds certain sizes (5.5-8.5 nm). The radius of a spherulite nanostructure increases linearly with time at the early stage, transitioning to nonlinear growth at the later stage. Furthermore, a thin layer of solid is accumulated at the tip and nanoparticles from secondary nucleation also appear at the growing front which later develop into fibrillar branches. The spherulite nanostructure is polycrystalline with the co-existence of ferrihydrite and Fe3O4 through-out the growth. A growth model is further established, which provides rational explanations on the linear growth at the early stage and the nonlinearity at the later stage of growth.W [Zheng, Wenjing; Du, Xiwen] Tianjin Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Inst New Energy Mat, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Wenjing; Hauwiller, Matthew R.; Liang, Wen-, I; Asta, Mark; Alivisatos, A.

Herein, we synthesized nickel sulfide (NiS) nanostructures using laser irradiation in an aqueous solution and under the ambient condition. Crystalline nanostructures with high phase-purity were achieved without further calcination. Other transition metal sulfides, such as CuS and ZnS, were also successfully synthesized using the laser irradiation approach, suggesting the practical application of this method. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) measurements show the NiS nanostructures synthesized for 4h (NiS-4h) not only exhibited competitive overpotential (-159 mV vs. RHE at 10 A/g), lower Tafel slope (218 mV/dec) but also delivered long-term stability (14 A/g at -250 mV vs. RHE for 12h). Moreover, the NiS-4h functioned as the electrode for supercapacitor with excellent specific capacitance (3761 F/g at 10 mV/s), reversibility and rate capability (1152 F/g at 100 mV/s). These superb electrochemical performances are attributed to the remarkable value of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and synergistic effect of Ni3+ OOH for HER electrocatalytic activities, while the co-existence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ facilitates the rich redox reactions of NiS for supercapacitor. [Hung, Tai-Feng; Yin, Zu-Wei; Betzler, Sophia B.; Zheng, Wenjing; Yang, Jiwoong; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hung, Tai-Feng] Ind Technol Res Inst, Energy Storage Technol Div, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, Hsinchu 31057, Taiwan; [Yin, Zu-Wei] Xiamen Univ, Coll Energy, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Wenjing] Tianjin Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Inst New Energy Mat, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√≠  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Industrial Technology Research Institute - Taiwan; Xiamen University; Tianjin University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√∏  Hung, TF; Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Hung, TF (corresponding author), Ind Technol Res Inst, Energy Storage Technol Div, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, Hsinchu 31057, Taiwan.$  taifeng@itri.org.tw; hmzheng@lbl.gos  Hung, Tai-Feng/K-4605-2019e  Hung, Tai-Feng/0000-0003-3304-6358; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Yin, Zuwei/0000-0002-0728-1154√Ä U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Bureau of Energy (BOE), Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), Taiwan; China Scholarship Council [201606310151]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation [201606310151] U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Bureau of Energy (BOE), Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), Taiwan; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation) This work was funded by U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the KC22ZH program.

Historically, attention in this area has focused on simple emulsions and foams, in which surface-active materials such as surfactants or colloids stabilize structures against coalescence and alter the mechanical properties of the interface. In recent decades, however, a growing body of work has begun to demonstrate the full potential of the assembly of nanomaterials at liquid-fluid interfaces to generate functionally advanced, biomimetic systems. Here, a broad overview is given, from fundamentals to applications, of the use of liquid-fluid interfaces to generate complex, all-liquid devices with a myriad of potential applications.z [Forth, Joe; Kim, Paul Y.; Xie, Ganhua; Liu, Xubo; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xie, Ganhua; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Liu, Xubo; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, AIMR, WPI, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan' United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Tohoku University	 Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, AIMR, WPI, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.;  Kim, Paul/GYV-3258-2022; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022g  Kim, Paul/0000-0003-0943-4924; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Forth, Joe/0000-0001-7263-6364[ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Army Research Office [W911NF-17-1-0003]; Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and EngineeringU U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Army Research Office; Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering√π This article is part of the Advanced Materials Hall of Fame article series, which recognizes the excellent contributions of leading researchers to the field of materials science.

The intrinsic valley lifetime in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) is expected to be markedly long due to the unique spin-valley locking behavior, where the intervalley scattering of the electron simultaneously requires a large momentum transfer to the opposite valley and a flip of the electron spin. However, the experimentally observed valley lifetime in 2D TMDs has been limited to tens of nanoseconds thus far. We report efficient generation of microsecond-long-lived valley polarization in WSe2/MoS2 heterostructures by exploiting the ultrafast charge transfer processes in the heterostructure that efficiently creates resident holes in the WSe2 layer. These valley-polarized holes exhibit near-unity valley polarization and ultralong valley lifetime: We observe a valley-polarized hole population lifetime of more than 1 ms and a valley depolarization lifetime (that is, intervalley scattering lifetime) of more than 40 mu s at 10 K. The near-perfect generation of valley-polarized holes in TMD heterostructures, combined with ultralong valley lifetime, which is orders of magnitude longer than previous results, opens up new opportunities for novel valleytronics and spintronics applications.√á [Kim, Jonghwan; Jin, Chenhao; Zhao, Tao; Lee, Puiyee; Kahn, Salman; Crommie, Michael F.; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kim, Jonghwan] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Chen, Bin; Cai, Hui; Tongay, Sefaattin] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Watanabe, Kenji; Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Crommie, Michael F.; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Crommie, Michael F.; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley & Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAp University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; National Institute for Materials Science; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California BerkeleyG Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley & Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.√ú  Tongay, Sefaattin/ACQ-5306-2022; JIN, CHENHAO/GYV-5734-2022; Chen, Bin/H-7618-2019; Kahn, Salman/AAM-8596-2020; Watanabe, Kenji/ABB-2135-2021; Cai, Hui/AAA-3998-2019; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015; Tongay, Sefaattin/E-6388-2011¬ß  Tongay, Sefaattin/0000-0001-8294-984X; Chen, Bin/0000-0002-2106-7664; Watanabe, Kenji/0000-0003-3701-8119; wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Cai, Hui/0000-0003-0848-3097¬† U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Elemental Strategy Initiative; NSF Division of Materials Research CAREER [1552220]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Van der Waals Heterostructures program [KCWF16]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1552220] Funding Source: National Science FoundationC U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Elemental Strategy Initiative; NSF Division of Materials Research CAREER; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Van der Waals Heterostructures program; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS))‚Äù This work was primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (Van der Waals Heterostructures program KCWF16).

Here, we show through a combination of in situ nanobeam electron diffraction and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that we can directly observe changes to the local short to medium range atomic ordering during the formation of a shear band. We observe experimentally a spatially resolved reduction of order prior to shear banding due to increased strain. We compare this to molecular dynamics simulations, in which a similar reduction in local order is seen, and caused by shear transformation zone activation, providing direct experimental evidence for this proposed nucleation mechanism for shear bands in amorphous solids. Our observation serves as a link between the atomistic molecular dynamics simulation and the bulk mechanical properties, providing insight into how one could increase ductility in glassy materials. [Pekin, Thomas C.; Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.; Minor, Andrew M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pekin, Thomas C.; Ozdol, Burak; Ophus, Colin; Minor, Andrew M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ding, Jun; Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gammer, Christoph] Austrian Acad Sci, Erich Schmid Inst Mat Sci, Jahnstr 12, A-8700 Leoben, Austria University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Austrian Academy of Sciences

Even at near contact, individual, two-dimensionally well-dispersed NPs were resolved. The potential of mean force, reduced to the pair interaction potential for dilute NPs, was extracted with good accuracy from the radial distribution function, as both NP diameter and grafted polymer chain length were varied. While NP polydispersity somewhat broadened the core repulsion, the pair potential well-approximated a hard sphere interaction, making these systems suitable for model studies of interfacially bound NPs. For short (5 kDa) poly(ethylene glycol) ligands, a weak (<k(B)T) long-range attraction was discerned, and for ligands of identical length, pair potentials overlapped for NPs of different diameter; the attraction is suggested to arise from ligand-induced menisci. To understand better the interactions underlying the pair potential, NP surface-binding energies were measured by interfacial tensiometry, and NP contact angles were assessed by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.# [Kim, Paul Y.; Gao, Yige; Ribbe, Alexander E.; Hoagland, David A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Chai, Yu; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu; Ashby, Paul D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R ChinaX University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Beijing University of Chemical Technologyj Hoagland, DA; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Rus√Ω√ø√ø√ø              	

Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network is denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid-like state. It is a challenge to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, since both jamming and vitrification lead to a solid-like behavior of the assemblies. Herein, we show a real-time fluorescence imaging method to probe the evo<    lution of the interfacial dynamics of NP surfactants at the water/oil interface using aggregation-induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. The AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior at densities at which they can move and rotate. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the smaller intermolecular separation distance arrests rotation, and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs.√ï [Gu, Pei-Yang; Zhou, Feng; Xu, Qing-Feng; Lu, Jian-Mei] Soochow Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Gu, Pei-Yang; Xie, Ganhua; Kim, Paul Y.; Hu, Qin; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Qin] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Microelect, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Liu, Feng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Collaborat Innovat Ctr IFSA CICIFSA, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Hu, Qin; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Shi, Shaowei; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan~ Soochow University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; City University of Hong Kong; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Tohoku University Lu, JM (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.m  Kim, Paul/GYV-3258-2022; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; gu, peiyang/HJH-4059-2023; Liu, Feng/J-4361-2014‚Äû  Kim, Paul/0000-0003-0943-4924; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Liu, Feng/0000-0002-5572-8512; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321= U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21938006, 51803143]; National Key Technology Research and Development Program [2020YFC1818401]; Basic Research Project of Leading Technology in Jiangsu Province [BK20202012]q U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Technology Research and Development Program(National Key Technology R&D Program); Basic Research Project of Leading Technology in Jiangsu Province0 The interfacial assembly, jamming and chromogenic behavior were supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

Here we investigate the fatigue-crack propagation properties of the equiatomic, single-phase, face -centered cubic, medium-entropy alloy (MEA), CrCoNi, that displays exceptional strength, ductility and toughness, all of which are enhanced at cryogenic temperatures. Fatigue-crack growth is examined, at a load ratio of 0.1 over a wide range of growth rates, from similar to 10(-11) to >10(-7) m/cycle, at room (293 K) and cryogenic (198 K, 77 K) temperatures for two grain sizes (similar to 7 and 68 mu m), with emphasis on near-threshold behavior. We find that the Delta K-th fatigue thresholds are increased with decreasing temperature and increasing grain size: from 5.7 MPa root m at 293 K to 8 MPa root m at 77 K in the fine-grained alloy, and from 9.4 MPa root m at 293 K to 13.7 MPa root m at 77 K in the coarse grained alloy. Mechanistically, transgranular cracking at 293 K transitions to a mixture of intergranular and transgranular at cryogenic temperatures, where the increased propensity of nano-twins appears to inhibit growth rates by deflecting the crack path. However, the main factor affecting near-threshold behavior is roughness-induced crack closure from interference between the crack flanks, which is enhanced by the rougher fracture surfaces at low temperatures, particularly in the coarser-grained microstructure. Fatigue-crack propagation behavior in CrCoNi is comparable to nickel-based superalloys but is superior to that of the high-entropy CrMnFeCoNi (Cantor) alloy and many high-strength steels, making the CrCoNi alloy an excellent candidate material for safety-critical applications, particularly involving low temperatures.

The nonequilibrium shapes of the suspended liquid phase can be rendered permanent by the jamming of the NP-surfactants formed and assembled at the interface between the liquids as the system attempts to minimize the interfacial area between the liquids. While critical to the structuring process, little is known of the dynamic mechanical properties of the NP-surfactant monolayer at the interface as it is dictated by the characteristics of the component, including NP size and concentration and the molecular weight and concentration of polymers bound to the NPs. Here we provide the first comprehensive understanding of the dynamic mechanical character of two-dimensional NP-surfactant assemblies at liquid/liquid interfaces. Our results indicate that the dynamics of NP-polymer interactions are self-regulated across multiple time scales and are associated with specific mesoscale interactions between self-similar and cross-complementary components. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the NP-surfactant monolayer are tunable over a broad range and deterministic on the basis of those component inputs. This control is key to tailoring the functional attributes of the reconfigurable structured liquids to suit specific applications.¬≥ [Huang, Caili; Liu, Feng; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huang, Caili; Liu, Feng; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huang, Caili; Cui, Mengmeng; Sun, Zhiwei; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan' United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Tohoku University‚Äî Helms, BA; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Helms, BA; Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.(  bahelms@lbl.gov; tom.p.russell@gmail.com9  Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; Liu, Feng/J-4361-2014≈í  Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Liu, Feng/0000-0002-5572-8512; Cui, Mengmeng/0000-0002-5494-6614; Helms, Brett/0000-0003-3925-4174Y U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231.B]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy¬§ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√ê This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

Here, we use a novel, modified dogbone geometry that permits the sampling of varying stress and strain regions within a single tensile specimen to characterize the onset of twinning in CrMnFeCoNi at 293 K, 198 K and 77 K. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and backscattered electron (BSE) imaging revealed the presence of deformation nano-twins in regions of the samples that had experienced plastic strains of similar to 25% at 293 K, similar to 16% at 198 K, and similar to 8% at 77 K, which are similar to the threshold strains described by Laplanche et al.<     (Acta Mater. 118, 2016, 152-163).

Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) on lithographically patterned templates has successfully been used to fabricate concentric rings and spirals as etching masks. However, this method is limited by BCP phase behavior and material selection. Here, a straightforward approach to generate ring-shaped nanoparticle assemblies in thin films of supramolecular nanocomposites is demonstrated. DSA is used to guide the formation of concentric rings with radii spanning 150-1150 nm and ring widths spanning 30-60 nm. When plasmonic nanoparticles are used, ring nanodevice arrays can be fabricated in one step, and the completed devices produce high-quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Nanocomposite DSA simplifies and streamlines nanofabrication by producing metal structures without etching or deposition steps; it also introduces interparticle coupling as a new design axis. Detailed analysis of the nanoparticle ring assemblies confirms that the supramolecular system self-regulates the spatial distribution of its components, and thus exhibits a degree of flexibility absent in DSA of BCPs alone, where structures are determined by polymer-pattern incommensurability.

Promising magnetocaloric materials display large changes in magnetic entropy<     (Delta S-M) upon application of a moderate magnetic field and are often associated with magnetic materials possessing some degree of magnetostructural coupling. In such compounds, the magnetic transition is coupled to some structural transition at the ordering temperature, and indicators for these are readily calculated by the magnetic deformation proxy Sigma(M). MnSb, with a Curie temperature T-C = 577 K, has a calculated magnetic deformation of Sigma(M) = 5.9% and is a promising candidate material for waste-heat recovery. The temperature dependence of structural, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties of Mn1+xSb, where x is a tunable amount of interstitial Mn, is studied here. Excess Mn is incorporated as an interstitial whose magnetic moment is antialigned with the stoichiometric Mn, and the excess Mn has the effect of lowering T-C, such that the Curie temperature can be tuned from 577 K to nearly room temperature at 318 K for x = 0.2. For x = 0.0, 0.1, and 0.2, values of Delta S-M under a maximum magnetic field H = 5 T are found to be 3.65, 3.00, and 2.83 J K-1 kg(-1), respectively. While the maximum Delta S-M decreases with x, the high refrigerant capacity a more holistic measure of performance-is retained in this highly tunable system.¬Æ [Seshadri, Ram] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Mat Dept, Mat Res Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Seshadri, Ram] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chemisby & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Cooley, Joya A.; Levin, Emily E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Mat Res Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Horton, Matthew K.; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Levin, Emily E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Mat Dept, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lapidus, Saul H.] Argonne Natl Lab, Xray Sci Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√æ University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√•  Seshadri, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Mat Dept, Mat Res Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;Seshadri, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chemisby & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.  seshadri@mrl.ucsb.edu]  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Seshadri, Ram/C-4205-2013; Lapidus, Saul/ABG-5632-2020¬è  Seshadri, Ram/0000-0001-5858-4027; Lapidus, Saul/0000-0002-7486-4325; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Cooley, Joya/0000-0001-7187-3261¬¨ National Science Foundation (NSF) [DMR-SSMC 1710638]; NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at UC Santa Barbara [DMR 1720256]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (Materials Project program) [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC23MP]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]√í National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at UC Santa Barbara; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (Materials Project program)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))∆í This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through DMR-SSMC 1710638.

Compared to more accurate hybrid functionals, we find that the widely used PBE generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional severely underpredicts MOF band gaps in a largely systematic manner for semi-conductors and insulators without magnetic character. However, an even larger and less predictable disparity in the band gap prediction is present for MOFs with open-shell 3d transition metal cations. With regards to partial atomic charges, we find that different density functional approximations predict similar charges overall, although hybrid functionals tend to shift electron density away from the metal centers and onto the ligand environments compared to the GGA point of reference. Much more significant differences in partial atomic charges are observed when comparing different charge partitioning schemes. We conclude by using the dataset of computed MOF properties to train machine-learning models that can rapidly predict MOF band gaps for all four density functional approximations considered in this work, paving the way for future high-throughput screening studies. To encourage exploration and reuse of the theoretical calculations presented in this work, the curated data is made publicly available via an interactive and user-friendly web application on the Materials Project.3 [Rosen, Andrew S.; Notestein, Justin M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rosen, Andrew S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Miller Inst Basic Res Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rosen, Andrew S.; O'Donnell, Cody T.; Horton, Matthew K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rosen, Andrew S.; Notestein, Justin M.; Snurr, Randall Q.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Fung, Victor] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Nanophase Mat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Huck, Patrick] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Truhlar, Donald G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem, Chem Theory Ctr & Minnesota Supercomp, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAI University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Northwestern University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences; United States Department of Energy <    (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory‚Äù Rosen, AS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Rosen, AS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Miller Inst Basic Res Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Rosen, AS (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Rosen, AS (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.  rosen@u.northwestern.edu  ; Truhlar, Donald/G-7076-2015¬è  Fung, Victor/0000-0002-3347-6983; Huck, Patrick/0000-0001-8237-2227; Notestein, Justin/0000-0003-1780-7356; Truhlar, Donald/0000-0002-7742-7294¬¶ Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences through the Nanoporous Materials Genome Center [DE-FG02-17ER16362]√™ Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley(University of California System); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences through the Nanoporous Materials Genome Center(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬Æ A.S.R. acknowledges support via a Miller Research Fellowship from the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley.

Moire superlattices can be used to engineer strongly correlated electronic states in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures, as recently demonstrated in the correlated insulating and superconducting states observed in magic-angle twisted-bilayer graphene and ABC trilayer graphene/boron nitride moire superlattices(1-4). Transition metal dichalcogenide moire heterostructures provide another model system for the study of correlated quantum phenomena(5) because of their strong light-matter interactions and large spin-orbit coupling. However, experimental observation of correlated insulating states in this system is challenging with traditional transport techniques. Here we report the optical detection of strongly correlated phases in semiconducting WSe2/WS2 moire superlattices. We use a sensitive optical detection technique and reveal a Mott insulator state at one hole per superlattice site and surprising insulating phases at 1/3 and 2/3 filling of the superlattice, which we assign to generalized Wigner crystallization on the underlying lattice(6-11). Furthermore, the spin-valley optical selection rules(12-14) of transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures allow us to optically create and investigate low-energy excited spin states in the Mott insulator. We measure a very long spin relaxation lifetime of many microseconds in the Mott insulating state, orders of magnitude longer than that of charge excitations. Our studies highlight the value of using moire superlattices beyond graphene to explore correlated physics.√π [Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing; Jin, Chenhao; Utama, M.

Here we introduce 'flexibility volume' as a universal indicator, to bridge the structural state the MG is in with its properties, on both atomic and macroscopic levels. The flexibility volume combines static atomic volume with dynamics information via atomic vibrations that probe local configurational space and interaction between neighbouring atoms. We demonstrate that flexibility volume is a physically appropriate parameter that can quantitatively predict the shear modulus, which is at the heart of many key properties of MGs. Moreover, the new parameter correlates strongly with atomic packing topology, and also with the activation energy for thermally activated relaxation and the propensity for stress-driven shear transformations. These correlations are expected to be robust across a very wide range of MG compositions, processing conditions and length scales.√ä [Ding, Jun; Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ding, Jun; Ma, Evan] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Cheng, Yong-Qiang] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Chem & Engn Mat Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Sheng, Howard] George Mason Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Johns Hopkins University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; George Mason University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley_  Ma, E (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.  ema@jhu.eduH  Ma, En/A-3232-2010; Ritchie, Robert O/A-8066-2008; Ding, Jun/K-1989-2012¬ç  Ritchie, Robert O/0000-0002-0501-6998; Ding, Jun/0000-0002-4091-8663; Sheng, Howard/0000-0002-6134-0354; Cheng, Yongqiang/0000-0002-3263-4812 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, through the Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering [DE-FG02-13ER46056]; Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy; NSF [DMR-1611064]; Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]∆í U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, through the Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))‚Äî The work at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, through the Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program (KC13) under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Prime candidates for these conditions are certain high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which have extraordinary work-hardening ability and toughness. By subjecting the equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi HEA to severe plastic deformation through swaging followed by either quasi-static compression or dynamic deformation in shear, we observe a dense structure comprising stacking faults, twins, transformation from the face-centered cubic to the hexagonal close-packed structure, and, of particular note, amorphization. The coordinated propagation of stacking faults and twins along {111} planes generates high-deformation regions, which can reorganize into hexagonal packets; when the defect density in these regions reaches a critical level, they generate islands of amorphous material. These regions can have outstanding mechanical properties, which provide additional strengthening and/or toughening mechanisms to enhance the capability of these alloys to withstand extreme loading conditions.F [Zhao, Shiteng; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Zezhou; Yang, Wen; Meyers, Marc A.] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zhu, Chaoyi] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Zhang, Zhouran; Armstrong, David E.

Ternary nitride materials, with many possible metastable polymorphs, provide a rich materials space to study what influences thermodynamic stability and polymorph synthesizability. For example, ZnZrN2 is theoretically predicted at zero Kelvin to have an unusual layered wurtsalt ground-state crystal structure with compelling optoelectronic properties, but it is unknown whether this structure can be realized experimentally under practical synthesis conditions. Here, we use combinatorial sputtering to synthesize hundreds of ZnxZr1-xNy thin-film samples, and find metastable rocksalt-derived or boron-nitride-derived structures rather than the predicted wurtsalt structure. Using a statistical polymorph sampler approach, it is demonstrated that although rocksalt is the least stable polymorph at zero Kelvin, it becomes the most stable polymorph at high effective temperatures similar to those achieved using this sputter deposition method, and thus corroborates experimental results. Additional calculations show that this destabilization of the wurtsalt polymorph is due to configurational entropic and enthalpic effects, and that vibrational contributions are negligible. Specifically, rocksalt- and boron-nitride-derived structures become the most stable polymorphs in the presence of disorder because of higher tolerances to cation cross substitution and off stoichiometry than the wurtsalt structure. This understanding of the role of disorder tolerance in the synthesis of competing polymorphs can enable more accurate predictions of synthesizable crystal structures and their achievable material properties.u [Woods-Robinson, Rachel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Appl Sci & Technol Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Woods-Robinson, Rachel; Horton, Matthew K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Woods-Robinson, Rachel; Stevanovic, Vladan; Lany, Stephan; Heinselman, Karen N.; Zakutayev, Andriy] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Ctr Mat Sci, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Stevanovic, Vladan] Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAÀú University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Colorado School of Mines; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryF Woods-Robinson, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Appl Sci & Technol Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Woods-Robinson, R (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Woods-Robinson, R (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Ctr Mat Sci, Golden, CO 80401 USA.1  rwoodsrobinson@lbl.gov; Andriy.Zakutayev@nrel.gov  ; Zakutayev, Andriy/C-6243-2008z  Woods-Robinson, Rachel/0000-0001-5009-9510; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Zakutayev, Andriy/0000-0002-3054-5525G U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC36-08GO28308]; Office of Science; Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Chemistry program; U.C.

Yet, the mechanisms governing these unusual carrier dynamics are not completely understood. A leading hypothesis-disproved in this work-is that a large, static bulk Rashba effect slows down carrier recombination. Here, using second harmonic generation rotational anisotropy measurements on MAPbI(3) crystals, we demonstrate that the bulk structure of tetragonal MAPbI(3) is centrosymmetric with I-4/mcm space group. Our calculations show that a significant Rashba splitting in the bandstructure requires a non-centrosymmetric lead iodide framework, and that incorrect structural relaxations are responsible for the previously predicted large Rashba effect. The small Rashba splitting allows us to compute effective masses in excellent agreement with experiment. Our findings rule out the presence of a large static Rashba effect in bulk MAPbI(3), and our measurements find no evidence of dynamic Rashba effects.√à [Frohna, Kyle; Bernardi, Marco] CALTECH, Dept Appl Phys & Mat Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Frohna, Kyle] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Deshpande, Tejas; Harter, John; Hsieh, David] CALTECH, Dept Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Peng, Wei; Bakr, Osman M.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, KAUST Catalysis Ctr KCC, Div Phys Sci & Engn, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Barker, Bradford A.; Neaton, Jeffrey B.; Louie, Steven G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Barker, Bradford A.; Neaton, Jeffrey B.; Louie, Steven G.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAv California Institute of Technology; Trinity College Dublin; California Institute of Technology; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory¬´  Bernardi, M (corresponding author), CALTECH, Dept Appl Phys & Mat Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.;Hsieh, D (corresponding author), CALTECH, Dept Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.  dhsieh@caltech.edu3  McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Bakr, Osman M./R-4963-2019¬´  Bakr, Osman M./0000-0002-3428-1002; Harter, John/0000-0002-7146-9370; Peng, Wei/0000-0002-7168-9795; Frohna, Kyle/0000-0002-2259-6154; Deshpande, Tejas/0000-0003-0326-1372{ Space Solar Program Initiative at the California Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology through the SURF fellowship program; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0010533]; Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, an NSF Physics Frontiers Center [PHY-1125565]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF1250]; KAUST; U.S. Department of Energy, Director, √Ω√ø√ø√ø‚Äö  ∆í  ‚Äû  ‚Ä¶  ‚Ä†  ‚Ä°  ÀÜ  ‚Ä∞  ≈†  ‚Äπ  ≈í  ¬ç  ≈Ω  ¬è  ¬ê  ‚Äò  ‚Äô  ‚Äú  ‚Äù  ‚Ä¢  ‚Äì  ‚Äî  Àú  ‚Ñ¢  ≈°  ‚Ä∫  ≈ì  ¬ù  ≈æ  ≈∏  ¬†  ¬°  ¬¢  ¬£  ¬§  ¬•  ¬¶  ¬ß  ¬®  ¬©  ¬™  ¬´  ¬¨  ¬≠  ¬Æ  ¬Ø  ¬∞  ¬±  ¬≤  ¬≥  ¬¥  ¬µ  ¬∂  ¬∑  ¬∏  ¬π  ¬∫  ¬ª  ¬º  ¬Ω  ¬æ  ¬ø  √Ä  √Å  √Ç  √É  √Ñ  √Ö  √Ü  √á  √à  √â  √ä  √ã  √å  √ç  √é  √è  √ê  √ë  √í  √ì  √î  √ï  √ñ  √ó  √ò  √ô  √ö  √õ  √ú  √ù  √û  √ü  √†  √°  √¢  √£  √§  √•  √¶  √ß  √®  √©  √™  √´  √¨  √≠  √Æ  √Ø  √∞  √±  √≤  √≥  √¥  √µ  √∂  √∑  √∏  √π  √∫  √ª  √º  √Ω  √æ  √ø    Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under the Theory FWP at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC2301]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231] Space Solar Program Initiative at the California Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology through the SURF fellowship program; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, an NSF Physics Frontiers Center(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); KAUST(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology); U.S. Department of Energy, Director, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under the Theory FWP at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬Ø M.B. acknowledges partial support from start-up funds and from the Space Solar Program Initiative at the California Institute of Technology.

We present here an automated adsorption workflow for semiconductors which employs density functional theory calculations to generate adsorption data in a high-throughput manner. Starting from a bulk structure, the workflow performs an exhaustive surface search, followed by an adsorption structure construction step, which generates a minimal energy landscape to determine the optimal adsorbate-surface distance. An extensive set of energy-based, charge-based, geometric, and electronic descriptors tailored toward catalysis research are computed and saved to a personal user database. The application of the workflow to zinc telluride, a promising CO2 reduction photocatalyst, is presented as a case study to illustrate the capabilities of this method and its potential as a material discovery tool.C [Andriuc, Oxana] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Andriuc, Oxana; Siron, Martin] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Liquid Sunlight Alliance & Chem Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Siron, Martin; Horton, Matthew; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, B<    erkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Siron, Martin; Horton, Matthew] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Siron, Martin; Montoya, Joseph H.] Toyota Res Inst, Los Altos, CA 94022 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA‚Äú University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Toyota Motor Corporation; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory‚Äú  Montoya, Joseph/0000-0001-5760-2860; Andriuc, Oxana/0000-0002-4011-3339; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Siron, Martin/0000-0002-4562-7814√ù Liquid Sunlight Alliance - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Fuels from Sunlight Hub [DE-SC0021266]; Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a DOE Energy Innovation Hub - Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DESC0004993]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC23MP]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC0205CH11231]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE 1752814]: Liquid Sunlight Alliance - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Fuels from Sunlight Hub; Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a DOE Energy Innovation Hub - Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))^ This work was funded by the Liquid Sunlight Alliance, which is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Fuels from Sunlight Hub under Award Number DE-SC0021266 and by the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a DOE Energy Innovation Hub, supported through the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Award Number DESC0004993.

Results of this method show good agreement with experimental values. This method is then used to better understand the low thermal expansion behavior of gum metal by comparing the thermal expansion tensor of Ti3Nb austenitic (beta) and martensitic (alpha '') gum metal approximants. The thermal expansion coefficient of beta is found to be in agreement with experimental results for that of annealed gum metal. The thermal expansion tensor of the alpha '' phase is shown to be highly anisotropic and exhibit negative thermal expansion along < 110 >(beta). It is demonstrated that the thermal expansion of the two-phase system, beta + alpha '',can be estimated using the rule of mixing. By applying this averaging scheme and allowing a texturing along < 110 >{001}(beta) in tandem with the growth of the alpha '' phase, values for the thermal expansion similar to that seen in cold-rolled gum metal are calculated.6 [Winter, I.

However, materials with excellent catalytic activity are typically limited to expensive precious metals, hindering their commercial viability. In response to this challenge, we have conducted the most extensive computational search to date for electrocatalysts that can facilitate NO3- reduction reaction, starting with 59 390 candidate bimetallic alloys from the Materials Project and Automatic-Flow databases. Using a joint machine learning- and computation-based screening strategy, we evaluated our candidates based on corrosion resistance, catalytic activity, N-2 selectivity, cost, and the ability to synthesize. We found that only 20 materials will satisfy all criteria in our screening strategy, all of which contain varying amounts of Cu. Our proposed list of candidates is consistent with previous materials investigated in the literature, with the exception of Cu-Co and Cu-Ag based c<    ompounds that merit further investigation.

However, the Li2MnO3 activation pathway and the CEI formation process are still controversial. Here, the first-cycle properties of xLi(2)MnO(3)-(1-x) LiNi0.3Co0.3Mn0.4O2 (x = 0, 0.5, 1) cathode materials were studied with an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). The results demonstrate that a synergistic effect between the layered Li2MnO3 and LiNi0.3Co0.3Mn0.4O2 structures can significantly affect the activation pathway of Li1.2Ni0.12Co0.12Mn0.56O2, leading to an extra-high capacity. It is demonstrated that Li2MnO3 activation in Li-rich materials is dominated by electrochemical decomposition (oxygen redox), which is different from the activation process of pure Li2MnO3 governed by chemical decomposition (Li2O evolution). CEI evolution is closely related to Li+ extraction/insertion. The valence state variation of the metal ions (Ni, Co, Mn) in Li-rich materials can promote CEI formation. This study is of significance for understanding and designing Li-rich cathode-based batteries.	 [Yin, Zu-Wei; Li, Jun-Tao; Deng, Ya-Ping; Wu, Zhen-Guo; Zhang, Tao; Mo, Yu-Xue; Wang, Kai; Sun, Shi-Gang] Xiamen Univ, Coll Energy, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Peng, Xin-Xing; Shen, Chong-Hen; Huang, Ling; Sun, Shi-Gang] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surface, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Yin, Zu-Wei; Peng, Xin-Xing; Zhang, Qu-Bo; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wu, Zhen-Guo; Wang, Kai] Sichuan Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qu-Bo] Southeast Univ, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, SEU FEI Nanopico Ctr, Key Lab MEMS,Minist Educ, Nanjing 210018, Jiangsu, Peoples R China√´  Xiamen University; Xiamen University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Sichuan University; Southeast University - China¬≥ Li, JT; Sun, SG (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Energy, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;Sun, SG (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surface, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.2  jtli@xmu.edu.cn; hmzheng@lbl.gov; sgsun@xmu.edu.cnk  Zhang, Tao/ABC-4308-2020; Wu, Zhenguo/AAB-8679-2021; Peng, Xinxing/U-4102-2019; Deng, Ya-Ping/AAB-4572-2020¬¨ This work is supported by NSFC (21621091) and Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China (2015J01063).

Two-dimensional (2D) materials are highly anis<    otropic, with thicknesses on the order of a nanometer and lateral dimensions upward of hundreds of nanometers to micrometers. Controlling the assembly of these materials has direct implications for their properties and performance.

Balcite (Ca0.5Ba0.5CO3) is a remarkable carbonate phase that is isostructural with a high-temperature modification of calcite (CaCO3), yet can be synthesized at ambient conditions. Here, we investigate crystallization pathways in the Ba-Ca-CO3-H2O system, with a focus on the transformation of amorphous calcium barium carbonate (ACBC) to balcite and subsequent decomposition into the equilibrium calcite (CaCO3) and witherite (BaCO3) phases. Density functional theory calculations show that balcite is an unstable solid solution (Ca1-xBaxCO3, R (3) over tildem) in the range 0.17 < x < 0.5, but is accessible through the amorphous ACBC precursor for x less than or similar to 0.5, and predict its decomposition into calcite and witherite. We confirm this pathway experimentally but found demixing to proceed slowly and remain incomplete even after 9 months. Nucleation kinetics of balcite from ACBC was assessed using a microfluidic assay, where increasing barium content led to a surprising increase in the balcite nucleation rate, despite decreasing thermodynamic driving force. We attribute crystallization rates that dramatically accelerate with time to changes in interfacial structure and composition during coarsening of the amorphous precipitate. By carefully quantifying the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions in the multistep crystallization of a metastable carbonate, we produce insights that allow us to better interpret the formation and persistence of metastable minerals in natural and synthetic environments.¬¶ [Whittaker, Michael L.; Duggins, Danielle O.; Joester, Derk] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Whittaker, Michael L.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Geosci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sun, Wenhao; Ceder, Gerbrand] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sun, Wenhao] Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 2300 Hayward St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA√∞  Northwestern University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Michigan System; University of Michiganb  Joester, D (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.  d-joster@northwestern.edu  Joester, Derk/B-7525-2009#  Ceder, Gerbrand/0000-0001-9275-3605√É NSF [DMR-1508399, DMR1905982]; ARO [W911NF-16-1-0262]; Soft and Hybrid Nanotechnology Experimental (SHyNE) Resource [NSF ECCS-1542205]; MRSEC Program at the Materials Research Center; the International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN) [NSF DMR1121262]; Keck Foundation; State of Illinois, through the IIN; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√Å NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF<    )); ARO; Soft and Hybrid Nanotechnology Experimental (SHyNE) Resource; MRSEC Program at the Materials Research Center; the International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN); Keck Foundation(W.M.

Conductive Ink with Circular Life Cycle for Printed ElectronicsV  3D printing; conductive ink; electronic waste; enzyme-containing composites; recycling  WASTE Electronic waste carries energetic costs and an environmental burden rivaling that of plastic waste due to the rarity and toxicity of the heavy-metal components. Recyclable conductive composites are introduced for printed circuits formulated with polycaprolactone (PCL), conductive fillers, and enzyme/protectant nanoclusters. Circuits can be printed with flexibility (breaking strain approximate to 80%) and conductivity (approximate to 2.1 x 10(4) S m(-1)). These composites are degraded at the end of life by immersion in warm water with programmable latency. Approximately 94% of the functional fillers can be recycled and reused with similar device performance. The printed circuits remain functional and degradable after shelf storage for at least 7 months at room temperature and one month of continuous operation under electrical voltage. The present studies provide composite design toward recyclable and easily disposable printed electronics for applications such as wearable electronics, biosensors, and soft robotics.6 [Kwon, Junpyo; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kwon, Junpyo; DelRe, Christopher; Ma, Le; Ritchie, Robert O.; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [DelRe, Christopher; Hall, Aaron; Jayapurna, Ivan; Ma, Le; Michalek, Matthew; Ritchie, Robert O.; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kang, Philjun; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Arnold, Daniel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA_ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley Xu, T (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Xu, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  Hall, Aaron/0000-0002-7739-201X√•  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (DOE-BES-MSE) [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]; US Department of Defense, Army Research Office [W911NF2110128] U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (DOE-BES-MSE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Defense, Army Research Office(United States Department of Defense)‚Ä∫ This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (DOE-BES-MSE) under Contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231, through the Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104 program.

Our multiscale approach spans from the study of a single chemically designed organic/inorganic interface to micrometer-thick films At the nanoscale, we relate the improved breakdown strength to the interfacial charge retention capability by combining scanning probe measurements and density functional theory calculations. At the meso- and macroscales, our findings highlight the relevance of the nanoparticle concentration and distribution in determining and enhancing the dielectric properties, as well as identifying this as a crucial limiting factor for the achievable sample size.≈Ω [Pieters, Priscilla F.; Xu, Ting; Alivisatos, A.

Amongst different halide double perovskites, Cs2AgBiBr6 has shown attractive optoelectronic properties and stability, making it a promising candidate for stable high-efficiency optoelectronic devices. Motivated by a data mining effort, we present here the effects of different processing strategies on the microstructure and thin-film formation dynamics of Cs2AgBiBr6. We apply some of the most successfully used solvent engineering approaches from the halide perovskite research to halide double perovskites, namely antisolvent- and additive-assisted synthesis. Using in situ spectroscopy and diffraction, the film formation of Cs2AgBiBr6 is investigated during spin coating, and the subsequent post-deposition thermal annealing. Dropping antisolvents during spin coating induces immediate supersaturation and crystallization of the wet film, whereas the time of dropping the antisolvent has implications on the film formation dynamics and the final microstructure. For additive (HBr)-assisted synthesis, we show how the addition of HBr affects colloid formation in solution and thus influences the crystallization pathway during thin-film processing. Finally, HBr additive simplifies synthesis in that it doesn't require solution and substrate preheating to obtain pinhole-free films even with higher thickness.‚Ä° [Abdelsamie, Maged; Cruse, Kevin; Ceder, Gerbrand] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA USA; [Cruse, Kevin; Ceder, Gerbrand] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tamura, Nobumichi] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, CA USA; [Sutter-Fella, Carolin M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAm  Sutter-Fella, CM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.?

Here, using the co-assembly of fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles and amine-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane, the assembly and jamming behavior of a new type of NPS at the oil-water interface is uncovered. Unlike solid inorganic nanoparticles, soft polymeric nanoparticles can reorganize when jammed, leading to a relaxation and deformation of the interfacial assemblies, for example, the 3D printed sugar-coated haw stick-like liquid tubules. With NPS serving as emulsifiers, stable Pickering emulsions are prepared that can be converted into robust colloidosomes with pH responsiveness, showing numerous potential applications for encapsulation and controlled release.U [Wang, Beibei; Yin, Bangqi; Yu, Hao; Zhang, Zhao; Wang, Guan; Shi, Shaowei; Gu, Xinggui; Yang, Wantai] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Tang, Ben Zhong] Chinese Univ Hong Kong Shenzhen, Shenzhen Inst Aggregate Sci & Technol, Sch Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gu, Xinggui] Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen; University of Massachusetts Sy<    stem; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences√∂  Wang, G; Shi, SW; Gu, XG (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Gu, XG (corresponding author), Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.H  wangguan@buct.edu.cn; shisw@mail.buct.edu.cn; guxinggui@mail.buct.edu.cn  Tang, Ben Zhong/B-3556-2009E  Tang, Ben Zhong/0000-0002-0293-964X; Shi, Shaowei/0000-0002-9869-4340√ñ National Natural Science Foundation of China [52173018, 52003023, 52173154, 51988102]; Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences [BNLMS202103]; National Science Foundation of China [21788102]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Army Research Office [W911NF-20-0093]√∫ National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Army Research Office‚Äπ This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52173018, 52003023, 52173154, and 51988102) .

Particle size largely affects the phase behavior of the nanocomposite. Theoretical studies indicate that new morphologies would emerge when the particles become comparable to the soft matrix's size, but this has rarely been supported experimentally. By designing a multicomponent blend composed of NPs, block copolymer-based supramolecules, and small molecules, a 3-D ordered lattice beyond the native BCP's morphology was recently reported when the particle is larger than the microdomain of BCP. The blend can accommodate various formulation variables. In this paper, when the particle size equals the microdomain size, a symmetry-broken phase appears in a narrow range of particle sizes and compositions, which we named the train track structure. In this phase, the NPs aligned into a 3-D hexagonal lattice and packed asymmetrically along the c axis, making the projection of the ac and the be plane resemble train tracks. Computational studies show that the broken symmetry reduces the polymer chain deformation and stabilizes the metastable hexagonally perforated lamellar morphology. Given the mobility of the multicomponent blend, the system shows a self-sorting behavior: segregating into two macroscopic phases with different nanostructures based on only a few nanometers NP size differences. Smaller NPs form train track morphology, while larger NPs form a simple hexagon structure, where the NPs take a symmetric hexagonal arrangement. Detailed structural evolution and simulation studies confirm the systematic-wide cooperativity across different components, indicating the strong self-regulation of the multicomponent system.¬¥ [Ma, Le; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ma, Le; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huang, Hejin; Alexander-Katz, Alfredo] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ercius, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAU University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley<  Huang, Hejin/0000-0002-9250-8797; Ma, Le/0000-0002-3583-3390√ø  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [AC02-05-CH112 31, KC3104]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231] This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, O ffi ce of Science, O ffi ce of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE- AC02-05-CH112 31 (Organic - Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104) .

We report bottom-up synthesis of atomically-precise one-dimensional (1D) arrays of point charges on graphene that allow exploration of a new type of supercritical confinement of graphene carriers. The arrays were synthesized by arranging F(4)TCNQ molecules into a 1D lattice on back-gated graphene, allowing precise tuning of both the molecular charge and the array periodicity. While dilute arrays of ionized F(4)TCNQ molecules are seen to behave like isolated subcritical charges, dense arrays show emergent supercriticality. In contrast to compact supercritical clusters, these extended arrays display both supercritical and subcritical characteristics and belong to a new physical regime termed frustrated supercritical collapse. Here carriers in the far-field are attracted by a supercritical charge distribution, but their fall to the center is frustrated by subcritical potentials in the near-field, similar to trapping of light by a dense cluster of stars in general relativity.√õ [Lu, Jiong; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Wickenburg, Sebastian; Omrani, Arash A.; Wong, Dillon; Riss, Alexander; Piatti, Erik; Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Ber<    keley, CA 94720 USA; [Lu, Jiong] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem, 3 Sci Dr 3, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Lu, Jiong; Tatan, Alpin N.; Pereira, Vitor M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Adv 2D Mat, 6 Sci Dr 2, Singapore 117546, Singapore; [Tsai, Hsin-Zon] Shenzhen Univ, Int Collaborat Lab 2D Mat Optoelect Sci & Tech, Engn Technol Res Ctr 2D Mat Informat Funct Device, Minist Educ, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Wickenburg, Sebastian; Wong, Dillon; Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tatan, Alpin N.; Pereira, Vitor M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, 2 Sci Dr 3, Singapore 117542, Singapore; [Piatti, Erik] Politecn Torino, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, I-10129 Turin, TO, Italy; [Watanabe, Kenji; Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, 11 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Riss, Alexander] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept E20, James Franck Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany¬Ω University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Shenzhen University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; National University of Singapore; Polytechnic University of Turin; National Institute for Materials Science; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Technical University of Munich‚Ç¨ Lu, J; Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Lu, J (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem, 3 Sci Dr 3, Singapore 117543, Singapore.;Lu, J; Pereira, VM (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Adv 2D Mat, 6 Sci Dr 2, Singapore 117546, Singapore.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Pereira, VM (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, 2 Sci Dr 3, Singapore 117542, Singapore.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.<  chmluj@nus.edu.sg; vpereira@nus.edu.sg; crommie@berkeley.edu≈Ω  Riss, Alexander/C-1565-2014; Wong, Dillon/G-8530-2013; Pereira, Vitor Manuel/D-4088-2009; Piatti, Erik/M-4456-2017; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/J-1682-2016√ò  Riss, Alexander/0000-0002-3212-7925; Wong, Dillon/0000-0002-4931-4188; Pereira, Vitor Manuel/0000-0002-3462-524X; Piatti, Erik/0000-0001-8733-5230; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/0000-0003-2097-0170; Tatan, Alpin/0000-0003-2227-7580 Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1203]; Molecular Foundry; National Science Foundation [DMR-1807233]; Singapore Ministry of Education [R-143-000-A06-112]; Shenzhen Peacock Plan [827-000113, KQJSCX20170727100802505, KQTD2016053112042971]; Singapore National Research Foundation; Singapore National Research Foundation award Novel 2D materials with tailored properties: beyond graphene [NRF-CRP6-2010-05] Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Molecular Foundry; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Shenzhen Peacock Plan; Singapore National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation, Singapore); Singapore National Research Foundation award Novel 2D materials with tailored properties: beyond graphene√î This research was supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, of the US Department of Energy under contract no.

A wealth of applications has been proposed for bijels in catalysis, energy storage and molecular encapsulation(3-5), but large domain sizes (on the order of 5 mu m or larger) and difficulty in fabrication pose major barriers to their use(6-8). Here, we show that bijels with sub-micrometre domains can be formed via homogenization, rather than spinodal decomposition. We achieve this by using nanoparticle surfactants: polymers and nanoparticles of complementary functionality (for example, ion-pairing) that bind to one another at the oil-water interface(9,10). This allows the stabilization of the bijel far from the demixing point of the liquids, with interfacial tensions on the order of 20 mN m(-1). Furthermore, our strategy is extremely versatile, as solvent, nanoparticle and ligand can all be varied.3 [Huang, Caili; Forth, Joe; Helms, Brett A.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huang, Caili; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Huang, Caili; Smith, Gregory S.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Neutron Sci Directorate, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Wang, Weiyu; Hong, Kunlun] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Nanophase Mat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan√¢ United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Tohoku University

Along with modifications of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), engineering the electrode has been reported to be effective in suppressing Na dendritic growth, likely by reducing localized current density accumulation. However, fundamental understanding of Na growth at the nanoscale is still limited.

Relatively large Na grains (in the micrometer scale) are achieved on the flat electrode surface. The local SEI thickness variations impact the growth rate, thus the morphology of individual grains. In contrast, small Na grains (in tens of nanometers) grow explosively on the electrode at the point with sharp curvature. The newly formed Na grains preferentially deposit at the base of existing grains close to the electrode. Further studies using continuum-based computational modeling suggest that the growth mode of an alkali metal (e.g. Na) is strongly influenced by the transport properties of SEI. Our direct observation of Na deposition in combination with the theoretical modeling provides insights for comprehensive understanding of electrode roughness and SEI effects on Na electrochemical deposition.‚Äö [Zeng, Zhiyuan; Lee, Seung-Yong; Yang, Juan; Zhang, Xiaowei; Zheng, Wenjing; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zeng, Zhiyuan] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Barai, Pallab; Srinivasan, Venkat] Argonne Natl Lab, Energy Syst Div, Lemont, IL USA; [Liu, Yi-Sheng; Guo, Jinghua] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustillo, Karen C.; Ercius, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Guo, Jinghua] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Cui, Yi] Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cui, Yi] Stanford Inst Mat & Energy Sci, SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAZ United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; City University of Hong Kong; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Stanford University; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley¬Ω  Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Cui, Y (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.#  yicui@stanford.edu; hmzheng@lbl.gov¬¶  Lee, Seung-Yong/AAV-5641-2021; Ercius, Peter/AAN-2870-2020; liu, yi/GXE-9662-2022; zhang, xiaowei/GQH-5387-2022; zeng, zhiyuan/G-7571-2015; Guo, Jinghua/AAZ-6492-2020¬Æ  Ercius, Peter/0000-0002-6762-9976; zeng, zhiyuan/0000-0001-7483-1438; Guo, Jinghua/0000-0002-8576-2172; Lee, Seung-Yong/0000-0002-8363-4142; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170w U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC22ZH]; DOE BES [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; City University of Hong Kong [9610435]; RGC in Hong Kong [9048163]; National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB632101]; China Scholarship Council [201406190080]; LDRD project at LBNL√ã U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE BES(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong); RGC in Hong Kong; National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); LDRD project at LBNL This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the in-situ TEM program (KC22ZH).

In condensed matter, for example, the chirality of electrons governs many unconventional transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect. Here we show that phonons can exhibit intrinsic chirality in monolayer tungsten diselenide. The broken inversion symmetry of the lattice lifts the degeneracy of clockwise and counterclockwise phonon modes at the corners of the Brillouin zone. We identified the phonons by the intervalley transfer of holes through hole-phonon interactions during the indirect infrared absorption, and we confirmed their chirality by the infrared circular dichroism arising from pseudoangular momentum conservation. The chiral phonons are important for electron-phonon coupling in solids, phonon-driven topological states, and energy-efficient information processing.√ô [Zhu, Hanyu; Yi, Jun; Xiao, Jun; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhu, Hanyu; Kaindl, Robert A.; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiang] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Ming-Yang; Yang, Chih-Wen; Li, Lain-Jong] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Phys Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Zhang, Lifa] Nanjing Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China√†  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Nanjing Normal University√õ  Wang, Y; Zhang, X (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, Y; Zhang, X (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.-  yuanwang@berkeley.edu; xzhang@me.berkeley.edu¬ª  Zhang, Lifa/D-7537-2012; Wang, Yuan/F-7211-2011; Wang, Yuan/HHC-1520-2022; Yi, Jun/ABE-8199-2020; Zhang, Xiang/F-6905-2011; Li, Lain-Jong/D-5244-2011; wangwangwang, yuanyaun/HHN-6432-2022 Zhang, Lifa/0000-0001-6108-1404; Wang, Yuan/0000-0001-7892-2812; Yi, Jun/0000-0003-2186-6615; Li, Lain-Jong/0000-0002-4059-7783; Zhu, Hanyu/0000-0003-3376-5352; Xiao, Jun/0000-0003-4248-8190; Zhang, Xiang/0000-0002-3272-894X; Yang, Chih-Wen/0000-0002-4381-9222≈í U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCWF16, KC12XZ]; Ultrafast Materials Science program [KC2203]; China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201606310094]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11574154]; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology through a Competitive Research Grant (CRG5)¬æ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Ultrafast Materials Science program; China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology through a Competitive Research Grant (CRG5)q We thank F.

An analysis based on density functional theory electronic structure calculations suggests that a high voltage close to 5 V is required to extract two Li ions and to reach the oxidation state of V5+.

Block copolymers (BCPs) containing a random copolymer (RCP) block present a convenient variation on traditional BCPs to tune the interaction parameters between the polymer blocks and the nanofillers as well as to evaluate the effect of the chain architecture on the NP arrangements within BCP microdomains. Here, we synthesized BCPs with a coil polystyrene (PS) block and a comb RCP block through reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The RCP block consists of methyl- and lauryl acrylates, the latter of which confers a long-chain alkyl moiety to favorably interact with alkyl-passivated NPs. BCPs showing lamellar, cylindrical, and mixed morphologies were obtained by varying the volume fractions of the RCP block (f(RCP)). In comparison to coil-coil BCP, the coil-comb BCPs show highly asymmetric phase behavior with respect to f(RCP), where lamellar morphologies were observed at f(RCP) from 0.31 to 0.51. NPs in the size of 4-5 nm were successfully incorporated in the RCP block of the BCPs with periodicities of 30-60 nm. An order-to-order phase transition from lamellae to PS cylinders was observed after the addition of only 1-2 vol % 5 nm NPs into the BCP with a periodicity of 25 nm and f RCP of 0.51. Self-consistent field theory-density functional theory simulations qualitatively described the observed morphologies and phase transitions in the nanocomposites. The current study presents a platform to fabricate nanocomposites with NP assemblies in coil-comb BCPs that contain a random copolymer block and provides insight into how polymer chain architectures can affect the phase behavior of BCPs and nanocomposites._ [Huang, Jingyu; Hall, Aaron; Jayapurna, Ivan; Algharbi, Samana; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ginzburg, Valeriy] Dow Chem Co USA, Core R&D, Midland, MI 48674 USA; [Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√≠  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Dow Chemical Company; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory6 Dow Chemical; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH1135]; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]p Dow Chemical; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))x This work was funded by Dow Chemical and the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104).

Herein, we develop a new quaternary GaInSnZn liquid metal with the melting temperature of 9.7 degrees C, which is the lowest among all reported Ga-based liquid metals. With high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we directly observed the oxide layer formed on the surface of the liquid metal. The initially formed oxide layer is revealed to be amorphous and very sensitive to electron beam. Prolonged irradiation results in its structural change from amorphous to crystalline phases. The present finding refreshes the basic understanding of surface oxidization of liquid metals and opens up the possibility of tuning surface structures and morphologies by using electron beam irradiation.¬∫ [Yu, Qing; Zong, Junjie; Liu, Suya; Wang, Xuelin; Wang, Xiaodong; Cao, Qingping; Zhang, Dongxian; Jiang, Jianzhong] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Lab New Struct Mat, ICNSM, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qing; Zong, Junjie; Liu, Suya; Wang, Xuelin; Wang, Xiaodong; Cao, Qingping; Jiang, Jianzhong] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiubo; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Dongxian] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Modern Opt Instrumentat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China√í  Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Zhejiang University√Æ  Jiang, JZ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Lab New Struct Mat, ICNSM, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.#  hmzheng@lbl.gov; jiangjz@zju.edu.cn  Yu, Qing/AAL-6858-2020?

Creating planar or locking structures is of particular interest for tuning electronic properties. While noncovalent locks are an effective strategy for increasing planarity, the precise interactions leading to these planar structures are often unknown or mischaracterized. In this study, we demonstrate that aromaticity can be used to investigate, interpret, and modify the complex physical interactions which lead to planarity. Furthermore, we clearly illustrate the important role aromaticity has in determining the structure through torsional preferences and find that modern noncovalent locks utilize hyperconjugation to alter aromaticity and increase planarity. We envision that our approach and our explanation of prevalent noncovalent locks will assist in the design of improved materials for organic electronics.r [Wood, Brandon M.; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wood, Brandon M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Forse, Alexander C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√í  Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.p  Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Wood, Brandon/0000-0002-7251-337X; Forse, Alexander/0000-0001-9592-9821 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Molecular Graphics and Computation Facility at the University of California Berkeley Chemistry Department [NIH S10OD023532] U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Molecular Graphics and Computation Facility at the University of California Berkeley Chemistry Department¬¥ This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

It is imperative to understand its damage-tolerant behaviour and to discern the mechanisms of damage evolution under in-service conditions. Here we perform in situ mechanical testing with synchrotron X-ray computed micro-tomography at temperatures between ambient and 1,000 degrees C on a nuclear-grade Gilsocarbon graphite. We find that both the strength and fracture toughness of this graphite are improved at elevated temperature. Whereas this behaviour is consistent with observations of the closure of microcracks formed parallel to the covalent-sp(2)-bonded graphene layers at higher temperatures, which accommodate the more than tenfold larger thermal expansion perpendicular to these layers, we attribute the elevation in strength and toughness primarily to changes in the residual stress state at 800-1,000 degrees C, specifically to the reduction in significant levels of residual tensile stresses in the graphite that are ` frozen-in' following processing.K [Liu, Dong] Univ Oxford, Dept Mat, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PH, England; [Gludovatz, Bernd; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Barnard, Harold S.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kuball, Martin] Univ Bristol, HH Wills Phys Lab, Ctr Device Thermog & Reliabil, Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TL, Avon, England; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 324 Hearst Min Bldg,MC 1760, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gludovatz, Bernd] UNSW Sydney, Sch Mech & Mfg Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia7 University of Oxford; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Bristol; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of New South Wales Sydney@ Liu, D (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Mat, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PH, England.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 324 Hearst Min Bldg,MC 1760, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA..  dong.liu@materials.ox.ac.uk; roritchie@lbl.gov;  Ritchie, Robert O/A-8066-2008; Gludovatz, Bernd/O-2121-2014K  Ritchie, Robert O/0000-0002-0501-6998; Gludovatz, Bernd/0000-0002-2420-3879√® EPSRC [EP/N004493/1, EP/K024345/1]; Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851; Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences Division of the U.S. Department of Energy [KC13, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Department of Energy; NERC [NE/I001816/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K024345/1, EP/N004493/1] Funding Source: researchfish¬• EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851; Mechanical Behavior of Materials Program at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) - Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences Division of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))$ This work was supported by EPSRC fellowship grant number EP/N004493/1 for D.L., who also acknowledges the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 for a Brunel Research Fellowship; M.K. acknowledges support by EPSRC under grant number EP/K024345/1.

Here, the authors reveal a multistep formation process of MOLs and identify missing clusters, dislocations, loop and flat surface terminations and ligand connector of MOLs via complementary electron microscopy techniques. Metal-organic layers (MOLs) are highly attractive for application in catalysis, separation, sensing and biomedicine, owing to their tunable framework structure. However, it is challenging to obtain comprehensive information about the formation and local structures of MOLs using standard electron microscopy methods due to serious damage under electron beam irradiation. Here, we investigate the growth processes and local structures of MOLs utilizing a combination of liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy, cryogenic electron microscopy and electron ptychography. Our results show a multistep formation process, where precursor clusters first form in solution, then they are complexed with ligands to form non-crystalline solids, followed by the arrangement of the cluster-ligand complex into crystalline sheets, with additional possible growth by the addition of clusters to surface edges. Moreover, high-resolution imaging allows us to identify missing clusters, dislocations, loop and flat surface terminations and ligand connectors in the MOLs. Our observations provide insights into controllable MOL crystal morphology, defect engineering, and surface modification, thus assisting novel MOL design and synthesis.^ [Peng, Xinxing; Pelz, Philipp M.; Zhang, Yaqian; Scott, Mary C.] Lawrence Berkeley <    Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pelz, Philipp M.; Zhang, Yaqian; Zheng, Haimei; Scott, Mary C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Qiubo; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Peican; Cao, Lingyun; Liao, Hong-Gang; Wang, Cheng; Sun, Shi-Gang] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China√∑  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Xiamen University‚Ñ¢ Scott, MC (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Scott, MC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Liao, HG (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.*  hgliao@xmu.edu.cn; mary.scott@berkeley.edu  ; Wang, Cheng/D-4487-2015¬è  Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Zhang, Qiubo/0000-0002-1649-9876; Pelz, Philipp Michael/0000-0002-8009-4515; Wang, Cheng/0000-0002-7906-8061g Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Strobe STC research center [DMR 1548924]; Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]¬ç Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Strobe STC research center; Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology(Samsung); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))‚Ç¨ Work at the Molecular Foundry was supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Nanocomposites have long been promised as an ideal option to fabricate metamaterials that harvest the collective properties enabled by ordered 3D NP assemblies. However, most of accessible NP assemblies, governed by their phase diagrams, are not suitable to achieve the targeted properties and require lengthy assembly processes. Here, we investigated the kinetic pathway of NP assembly in lamellar supramolecular nanocomposite thin films during solvent vapor annealing and after solvent removal. By balancing the solvent field, diffusion rate, and thermodynamic driving force during rapid solvent removal (<3 s), we produced well-ordered 3D NP assemblies far away from the equilibrium state. Their degree of ordering depends on the terminal solvent fraction rather than the exact rapid solvent removal rate. The periodicity of these nanocomposites can be readily decoupled from the NP size and reduced to similar to 50% of the periodicity in melt. The current study provides a facile approach to access nonequilibrium structures in nanocomposite thin films for the fabrication of functional metamaterial coatings. [Huang, Jingyu; Bai, Peter; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huang, Jingyu; Bai, Peter; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Xiangfan; Hai, Rihan; Sun, Cheng] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Chen, Xiangfan] Arizona State Univ, Polytech Sch, Mesa, AZ 85212 USAN University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Northwestern University; Arizona State Universityh  Sun, Cheng/B-7609-2009; Chen, Xiangfan/M-3719-2016; Chen, Xiangfan/AAH-6557-2021; Sun, Cheng/A-8111-2010‚Ä†  Chen, Xiangfan/0000-0002-5627-7530; Chen, Xiangfan/0000-0002-5627-7530; Hai, Rihan/0000-0003-3575-1501; Sun, Cheng/0000-0002-2744-0896≈Ω U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]; NSF [EEC1530734]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH1135]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√û U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√å This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104).

However, their unstructured and highly heterogenous format creates a significant obstacle to large-scale analysis of the information contained within. Recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) has provided a variety of tools for high-quality information extraction from unstructured text. These tools are primarily trained on non-technical text and struggle to produce accurate results when applied to scientific text, involving specific technical terminology. During the last years, significant efforts in information retrieval have been made for biomedical and biochemical publications. For materia<    ls science, text mining (TM) methodology is still at the dawn of its development. In this review, we survey the recent progress in creating and applying TM and NLP approaches to materials science field.

Here, we report a hybrid bottom-up synthesis of GNRs based on a Matrix-Assisted Direct (MAD) transfer technique that successfully leverages technical advantages inherent to both solution-based and on-surface synthesis while sidestepping their drawbacks. Critical structural parameters tightly controlled in solution-based polymerization reactions can seamlessly be translated into the structure of the corresponding GNRs. The transformative potential of the synergetic bottom-up approaches facilitated by the MAD transfer techniques is highlighted by the synthesis of chevron-type GNRs (cGNRs) featuring narrow length distributions and a nitrogen core-doped armchair GNR (N-4-7-ANGR) that remains inaccessible using either a solution-based or an on-surface bottom-up approach alone.¬Æ [McCurdy, Ryan D.; Piskun, Ilya; Veber, Gregory C.; Fischer, Felix R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jacobse, Peter H.; Rizzo, Daniel J.; Zuzak, Rafal; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mutlu, Zafer; Bokor, Jeffrey] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bokor, Jeffrey; Crommie, Michael F.; Fischer, Felix R.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Crommie, Michael F.; Fischer, Felix R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Crommie, Michael F.; Fischer, Felix R.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬∞ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory‚Äû Fischer, FR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Fischer, FR (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Fischer, FR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Fischer, FR (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  ffischer@berkeley.eduf  Zuzak, Rafal/0000-0001-6617-591X; Rizzo, Daniel/0000-0003-4587-4863; McCurdy, Ryan/0000-0001-7319-4836+ Office of Naval Research [N00014-19-1-2503]; MURI Program [N00014-16-1-2921]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1203]; National Science Foundation [CHE-1807474, DMR-1839098]; Center for Energy Efficient Electronics NSF [0939514]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NSF [ECCS-1542152]; NIH [S10OD024998]; Dutch Research Council through the Rubicon Award [019.182EN.18]≈ì Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); MURI Program(MURI); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Center for Energy Efficient Electronics NSF; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Dutch Research Council through the Rubicon Award¬¨ This work was funded by the Office of Naval Research under N00014-19-1-2503 (synthesis of monomer and polymer precursors) and MURI Program N00014-16-1-2921 (STM imaging), by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 (Nanomachine program KC1203) (surface reaction, cyclization), by the National Science Foundation under Award No. CHE-1807474 (MAD transfer equipment development) and Award No. DMR-1839098 (SPM spectroscopy), and by the Center for Energy Efficient Electronics NSF Award 0939514 (data analysis).

As the areal density of NPs at the interface increases, the available interfacial area decreases, and the interfacial dynamics of the NP assemblies change when the NPs jam. Dynamics associated with jamming was investigated by X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. Water-in-toluene emulsions, formed by a self-emulsification at the liquid/liquid interface and stabilized by ligand-capped CdSe-ZnS NPs, provided a simple, yet powerful platform, to investigate NP dynamics. In contrast to a single planar interface, these emulsions increased the number of NPs in the incident beam and decreased the absorption of X-rays in comparison to the same path length in pure water. A transition from diffusive to confined dynamics was manifested by intermittent dynamics, indicating a transition from a liquid-like to a jammed state." [Cui, Mengmeng; Miesch, Caroline; Kosif, Irem; Kim, Paul Y.; Kim, Hyunki; Emrick, Todd; Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Nie, Huarong] Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Polymer Sci & Engn, Key Lab Rubber Plast, Qingdao 266042, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cylcotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China√Ø  University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Qingdao University of Science & Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Beijing University of Chemical Technology~ Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cylcotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.j  Kim, Paul/0000-0003-0943-4924; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Cui, Mengmeng/0000-0002-5494-6614H U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Basic Energy Science [DE-FG02-04ER46126];  [NSF-CHE-1506839]Y U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Basic Energy Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE));  This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

Nanoscopically embedded enzymes can lead to near-complete degradation of polyesters via chain-end mediated processive depolymerization. The overall degradation rate and pathways have a strong dependence on the morphology of semicrystalline polyesters. Yet, most studies to date focus on pristine polymers instead of mixtures that contain additives and other components despite their nearly universal use in plastic production. Here, additives are introduced to purposely change the morphology of polycaprolactone (PCL) by increasing the bending and twisting of crystalline lamellae. These morphological changes immobilize chain ends preferentially at the crystalline/amorphous interfaces and limit chain-end accessibility by the embedded processive enzyme. This chain-end redistribution reduces the polymer-to-monomer conversion from >95% to less than 50%, causing formation of highly crystalline plastic pieces, including microplastics. By synergizing both random chain scission and processive depolymerization, it is feasible to navigate morphological changes in polymer/additive blends and to achieve near-complete depolymerization. The random scission enzymes in the amorphous domains create new chain ends that are subsequently bound and depolymerized by processive enzymes. Present studies further highlight the importance to consider how the host polymer's morphologies affect the reactions catalyzed by embedded catalytic species.I [DelRe, Christopher; Chang, Boyce; Jayapurna, Ivan; Hall, Aaron; Wang, Ariel; Zolkin, Kyle; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [DelRe, Christopher; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬† U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (DOE-BES-MSE) [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]; US Department of Defense, Army Research Office [W911NF2110128]; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NIH [S10OD024998]( U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (DOE-BES-MSE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Defense, Army Research Office(United States Department of Defense); National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)B This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (DOE-BES-MSE) under Contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231, through the Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104 program (C.D., B.C., Blend morphology, degradation process and NMR studies).

As high as 11 dB extinction ratio is achieved by varying the voltage applied to a single atomic layer of graphene on a HCG resonator. The device topology facilitates easy fabrication of large 2D arrays, and free-space operation. We also demonstrate a graphene-oxide-graphene structure which can potentially operate at MHz operation speed. The devices are fully fabricated by standard CMOS compatible processes indicating that the integrated structure of graphene-on-HCG shows great promise for display, imaging and interconnects applications with low-cost and large scalability.

For example, the fundamental Paris law which relates the crack growth rate to stress-intensity factor range is still phenomenological and no reliable mechanistic model has been established for a given material or class of materials despite numerous investigations over a half a century. This work is an attempt to theoretically model fatigue crack propagation induced by alternating crack-tip plastic blunting and re-sharpening in the mid-range of growth rates on the basis of inputs from experiments that measure macroscopic material behavior, e.g., response to uniaxial cycling loading. In particular, we attempt to predict Paris law behavior by accounting for the material constitutive behavior in response to cyclic loading by modeling crack advance solely in terms of the underlying plastic dissipation. We obtain the steady-state condition for crack growth based on plastic dissipation, numerically using finite element analysis, which involves a methodology to address plastic closure upon unloading. For a given stress-intensity range, we calculate the crack propagation rate from the steady-state condition through each cycle of loading and unloading of a cracked compact-tension specimen, without resorting to any specific criterion for crack advance.

When polymers preferentially precipitate on the NP surfaces, small NP clusters form and serve as nuclei for NP crystal growth in dilute solutions. This precipitation-induced NP crystallization process is applicable for a range of polymers, and the resultant 3-D NP crystals are tunable by varying polymeric additives loading, solvent evaporation rate, and NP size. The present study elucidates how to balance cohesive energy density and NP diffusivity to simultaneously favor nuclei formation energetically and kinetic growth in dilute solutions to rapidly crystalize NPs over multiple length scales. Furthermore, the amount of impurities needed to grow NP crystals (<0.1%) reminds us the importance of fine details to interpret experimental observations in nanoscience. Growing nanoparticle crystals typically requires strict control over interparticle interactions and assembly. Here, the authors show that a trace amount of polymeric impurities induces reproducible, rapid growth of high quality 3D nanoparticle crystals in solution and on patterned substrates. [Qian, Yiwen; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Qian, Yiwen; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [da Silva, Alessandra; Theis, Wolfgang] Univ Birmingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Nanoscale Phys Res Lab, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Yu, Emmy; Anderson, Christopher L.; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Anderson, Christopher L.; Liu, Yi; Ercius, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA USAB University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Birmingham; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryO  Ercius, Peter/AAN-2870-2020; Theis, Wolfgang/AAA-3195-2022; Liu, yi/A-3384-2008¬ç  Ercius, Peter/0000-0002-6762-9976; Liu, yi/0000-0002-3954-6102; Theis, Wolfgang/0000-0002-4074-8318; da Silva, Alessandra/0000-0003-0465-504X4 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC3104]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH1135]; Brazilian National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq)√ã U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Brazilian National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))¬† This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 (Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104).

The amorphous materials exhibited a substantial spin polarization (generally greater than 60%), despite significant changes in magnetization and resistivity. In particular, the polarization value in the x = 0.65 amorphous alloy is about 70%, significantly higher than most ferromagnets, including numerous Heusler compounds that are theoretically predicted to be half-metallic ferromagnets. The composition dependence of the spin polarization in the amorphous materials is proportional to (but substantially larger than) the DFT-calculated values. The polarization of a crystalline thin film with x = 0.65, by contrast, is only 49%, similar to that of common magnetic metals. The enhanced spin polarization in the amorphous structure is attributed to the modification of the local environments. This work demonstrates that the spin polarization, as well as magnetic moment, anomalous Hall effect, and electrical resistivity, can be tuned by introducing structural disorder as an engineering tool.\ [Karel, J.] Monash Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Karel, J.; Bouma, D.

Formation of a good solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been considered to be effective in limiting lithium dendrite growth. However, how the SEI may be modified during lithium deposition is hard to resolve due to challenges inin situinvestigation of the SEI with fine details. We report anin situstudy that uncovers the lithium dendrite suppression mechanism arising from SEI modification by a poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) cationic polymer film, using electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Lithium nanogranules are obtained in the presence of the polymer film. Chemical mapping of the deposits provides remarkable details of the SEI on individual nanogranules. It shows that lithium fluorides are uniformly distributed within the inner SEI layer of individual lithium nanogranules, arising from the instantaneous reaction of the deposited lithium with PF(6)(-)ions accumulated by the cationic polymer film, and thus the dendritic growth of lithium is prohibited. The ability to directly measure SEI chemistry at the nanoscale down to the individual nanograinsin situand unveil its correlation with the lithium deposition behavior opens future opportunities to explore unsolved mechanisms in batteries.y [Lee, Seung-Yong; Shangguan, Junyi; Betzler, Sophia; Harris, Stephen J.; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shangguan, Junyi; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Alvarado, Judith; Doeff, Marca M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA USA7  Lee, Seung-Yong/AAV-5641-2021; Doeff, Marca/G-6722-2013¬ç  Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Doeff, Marca/0000-0002-2148-8047; Lee, Seung-Yong/0000-0002-8363-4142; Harris, Stephen/0000-0002-5211-39342 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; LDRD fund at LBNL] U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); LDRD fund at LBNL√∏ This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the KC22ZH program.

Only recently has the complexity of these surface states been appreciated: they are composed of several atomic orbitals with distinct spin textures in momentum space. A complete picture of the wave function must account for this orbital dependence of spin. We discover that symmetry constrains the way orbital and spin components of a state coevolve as a function of momentum, and from this, we determine the rules governing how the two degrees of freedom are interwoven. We directly observe this complexity in spin-resolved photoemission and ab initio calculations of the topological surface states of Sb(111), where the photoelectron spin direction near (Gamma) over bar is found to have a strong and unusual dependence on photon polarization. This dependence unexpectedly breaks down at large |k|, where the surface states mix with other nearby surface states. However, along mirror planes, symmetry protects the distinct spin orientations of different orbitals. Our discovery broadens the understanding of surface states with strong spin-orbit coupling, demonstrates the conditions that allow for optical manipulation of photoelectron spin, and will be highly instructive for future spintronics applications.≈í [Gotlieb, Kenneth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gotlieb, Kenneth; Li, Zhenglu; Lin, Chiu-Yun; Louie, Steven G.; Lanzara, Alessandra] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Zhenglu; Lin, Chiu-Yun; Louie, Steven G.; Lanzara, Alessandra] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jozwiak, Chris; Hussain, Zahid] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ryoo, Ji Hoon; Park, Cheol-Hwan] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Phys, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Ryoo, Ji Hoon; Park, Cheol-Hwan] Seoul Natl Univ, Ctr Theoret Phys, Seoul 08826, South Koreaj University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU)¬º  Louie, SG (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Louie, SG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.&  sglouie@berkeley.edu; alanzara@lbl.gov‚Äô  Park, Cheol-Hwan/A-1543-2009; Ryoo, Ji Hoon/N-7643-2018; lanzara, alessandra/AAC-9535-2020; Ryan, Sheena/R-2234-2018; Hussain, Zahid/HGU-8912-2022¬è  Park, Cheol-Hwan/0000-0003-1584-6896; Ryoo, Ji Hoon/0000-0003-2212-4939; Hussain, Zahid/0000-0003-4989-6496; Jozwiak, Chris/0000-0002-0980-3753√´ U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Quantum Materials Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC2202]; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Theory of Materials Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC2301]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1508412, ACI-1053575, DGE 1106400]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; DOE Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Research Foundation of Korea - MSIP [NRF-2016R1A1A1A05919979]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1508412] Funding Source: National Science Foundation= U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Quantum Materials Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Theory of Materials Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Research Foundation of Korea - MSIP; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS))¬¢ The experimental work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 within the Quantum Materials Program (KC2202).

During oriented attachment of semiconductor nanocrystals, neck can be formed between nanocrystals and it strongly influences the properties of the resulting superlattice. However, the neck formation mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we use in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy to directly observe the initiation and growth of homoepitaxial necks between PbSe nanocrystals with atomic details. We find that neck initiation occurs slowly (similar to 10 s) when two nanocrystals approach to each other within an edge-to-edge distance of 0.6 nm. During neck initiation, Pb and Se atoms defuse from other facets into the gap, forming dy<    namic reversible filaments. Once the filament (neck) width is larger than a critical size of 0.9 nm, it gradually (15 s) widens into a 3-nm-wide neck. The atomic structure of the neck is further obtained using ex situ aberration-corrected scanning TEM imaging. Neck initiation and growth mechanisms are elucidated with density functional theory calculations. Our direct unveiling of the atomic pathways of neck formation during oriented attachment shed light into the fabrication of nanocrystal superlattices with improved structural order and electronic properties.\ [Wang, Yu; Peng, Xinxing; Zhang, Bing-Kai; Wang, Lin-Wang; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Yu; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Peng, Xinxing] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Abelson, Alex; Qian, Caroline; Law, Matt] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Ercius, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Natl Ctr Elect Microscopy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA9 United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Xiamen University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryÀú  Peng, Xinxing/U-4102-2019; wang, lili/HDL-7210-2022; wang, lin/GSE-3040-2022; Wang, Yu/D-7308-2017; wang, lin/HHM-2225-2022; Ercius, Peter/AAN-2870-2020¬•  Wang, Yu/0000-0002-9029-1846; Ercius, Peter/0000-0002-6762-9976; Qian, Caroline/0000-0002-6098-8327; Law, Matt/0000-0001-7645-9908; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170√à U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within in-situ TEM (KC22ZH) program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; UC Office of the President under the UC Laboratory Fees Research Program Collaborative Research and Training Award [LFR-17-477148]; China Scholarship Council; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√æ U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within in-situ TEM (KC22ZH) program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); UC Office of the President under the UC Laboratory Fees Research Program Collaborative Research and Training Award; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬¢ This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the in-situ TEM (KC22ZH) program.

It takes the Sommerfeld value of L-0 = (pi(2)/3)(k(B)/e)(2) in simple, metallically electronic systems where charge and heat are both carried by the same group of quasi-particles that experience elastic scattering. Higher values of L than L-0 are possible in semiconductors where both electrons and holes co-exist at high densities, that is, in bipolar conduction. As a narrow-bandgap semiconductor, Bi2Te3 exhibits L > L-0 which has been generally attributed to such bipolar conduction mechanisms. However, in this work, we report that L > L-0 is still observed in individual, single-crystal Bi2Te3 nanoribbons even at low temperatures and when degenerately doped, that is, far from the bipolar conduction condition. This discovery calls for different mechanisms to explain the unconventional electronic thermal transport behavior in Bi2Te3.

Achieving this, however, requires the creation of three-terminal devices that allow single molecules to be both gated and imaged at the atomic scale. We have accomplished this by integrating a graphene field effect transistor with a scanning tunnelling microscope, thus allowing gate-controlled charging and spectroscopic interrogation of individual tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane molecules. We observe a non-rigid shift in the molecule's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (relative to the Dirac point) as a function of gate voltage due to graphene polarization effects. Our results show that electron-electron interactions play an important role in how molecular energy levels align to the graphene Dirac point, and may significantly influence charge transport through individual molecules incorporated in graphene-based nanodevices.- [Wickenburg, Sebastian; Lu, Jiong; Lischner, Johannes; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Omrani, Arash A.; Riss, Alexander; Karrasch, Christoph; Bradley, Aaron; Jung, Han Sae; Khajeh, Ramin; Wong, Dillon; Zettl, Alex; Louie, Steven G.; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wickenburg, Sebastian; Zettl, Alex; Louie, Steven G.; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lu, Jiong] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem, 3 Sci Dr 3, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Lu, Jiong; Neto, A.

A key feature of two-dimensional materials is that the sign and concentration of their carriers can be externally controlled with techniques such as electrostatic gating. However, conventional electrostatic gating has limitations, including a maximum carrier density set by the dielectric breakdown, and ionic liquid gating and direct chemical doping also suffer from drawbacks. Here, we show that an electron-beam-induced doping technique can be used to reversibly write high-resolution doping patterns in hexagonal boron nitride-encapsulated graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) van der Waals heterostructures. The doped MoS2 device exhibits an order of magnitude decrease of subthreshold swing compared with the device before doping, whereas the doped graphene devices demonstrate a previously inaccessible regime of high carrier concentration and high mobility, even at room temperature. We also show that the approach can be used to write high-quality p-n junctions and nanoscale doping patterns, illustrating that the technique can create nanoscale circuitry in van der Waals heterostructures. [Shi, Wu; Kahn, Salman; Jiang, Lili; Wang, Sheng-Yu; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Wong, Dillon; Wang, Feng; Crommie, Michael F.; Zettl, Alex] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shi, Wu; Kahn, Salman; Jiang, Lili; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Wong, Dillon; Wang, Feng; Crommie, Michael F.; Zettl, Alex] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shi, Wu; Kahn, Salman; Jiang, Lili; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Wong, Dillon; Wang, Feng; Crommie, Michael F.; Zettl, Alex] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shi, Wu; Kahn, Salman; Jiang, Lili; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Wong, Dillon; Wang, Feng; Crommie, Michael F.; Zettl, Alex] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Taniguchi, Takashi; Watanabe, Kenji] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, JapanR University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; National Institute for Materials Science≈ì  Wong, Dillon/G-8530-2013; Kahn, Salman/AAM-8596-2020; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/J-1682-2016; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015; Watanabe, Kenji/ABB-2135-2021; Shi, Wu/I-4204-2014√à  Wong, Dillon/0000-0002-4931-4188; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/0000-0003-2097-0170; wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Watanabe, Kenji/0000-0003-3701-8119; Shi, Wu/0000-0002-6458-4776; Kahn, Salman/0000-0002-0012-3305√∞ Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, and Molecular Foundry of the US Department of Energy within the van der Waals Heterostructures Program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCWF16]; National Science Foundation [1542741, 1807233]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, and Molecular Foundry of the US Department of Energy within the sp2-Bonded Materials Program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC2207]√∞ Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, and Molecular Foundry of the US Department of Energy within the van der Waals Heterostructures Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, and Molecular Foundry of the US Department of Energy within the sp2-Bonded Materials Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)) We thank Y.

However, this type of pseudoelectroelasticity has not been confirmed in situ, and no details on the microscopic mechanism are known. Here, we in situ monitor the pseudoelectroelasticity of monocrystalline Cu2S nanowires (NWs) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specifically, we reveal the atomic scale details including phase transformation, migration and redox reactions of Cu+ ions, nucleation, growth, as well as spontaneous shrinking of Cu protrusion. Caterpillar-diffusion-dominated deformation is confirmed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation and ab initio calculation, which can be driven by either an external electric field or chemical potential difference. The observed spring-like behavior was creatively adopted for electric nanoactuators. Our findings are crucial to elucidate the mechanism of pseudoelectroelasticity and could potentially stimulate in-depth research into electrochemical and nanoelectromechanical systems. [Zhang, Qiubo; Yin, Kuibo; Dong, Hui; Xu, Feng; Yu, Kaihao; Zhang, Hongtao; Sun, Litao] Southeast Univ, Minist Educ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr MicroNano Fabricat Device, SEU FEI Nanopico Ctr,Key Lab MEMS, Nanjing 210018, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiubo; Peng, Xinxing; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shi, Zhe] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chen, Chia-Chin] Max Planck Inst Solid State Res, Heisenbergstr 1, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Valov, Ilia] Res Ctr Juelich, Peter Gruenberg Inst, Elect Mat, D-524253 Julich, Germany; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sun, Litao] Joint Res Inst Southeast Univ & Monash Univ, Ctr Adv Mat & Mfg, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China! Southeast University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Max Planck Society; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; University of California System; University of California Berkeleyo Sun, LT (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Minist Educ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr MicroNano Fabricat Device, SEU FEI Nanopico Ctr,Key Lab MEMS, Nanjing 210018, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Valov, I (corresponding author), Res Ctr Juelich, Peter Gruenberg Inst, Elect Mat, D-524253 Julich, Germany.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Sun, LT (corresponding author), Joint Res Inst Southeast Univ & Monash Univ, Ctr Adv Mat & Mfg, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.6  i.valov@fz-juelich.de; hmzheng@lbl.gov; slt@seu.edu.cnb  Valov, Ilia/J-7021-2013; Sun, Litao/D-4289-2013; Pen<    g, Xinxing/U-4102-2019; Yin, Kuibo/G-5812-2011√É  Valov, Ilia/0000-0002-0728-7214; Sun, Litao/0000-0002-2750-5004; Yin, Kuibo/0000-0001-5268-6807; Shi, Zhe/0000-0001-9282-8881; Peng, Xinxing/0000-0002-7077-8454; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170¬∑ National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0204800]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51420105003, 11327901, 11525415, 11674052]; China Scholarship Council [201606090071]; Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University [YBPY1708]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]√Ö National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))^ This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFA0204800) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 51420105003, 11327901, 11525415, 11674052).

However, conventional methods based on substitutional doping or surface functionalization result in the degradation of electrical mobility due to structural disorder, and the maximum doping density is set by the solubility limit of dopants. Here we show that a reversible laser-assisted chlorination process can be used to create high doping concentrations (above 3 x 10(13) cm(-2)) in graphene monolayers with minimal drops in mobility. The approach uses two lasers-with distinct photon energies and geometric configurations-that are designed for chlorination and subsequent chlorine removal, allowing highly doped patterns to be written and erased without damaging the graphene. To illustrate the capabilities of our approach, we use it to create rewritable photoactive junctions for graphene-based photodetectors. Two laser beams with different energies and configurations can be used to reversibly dope graphene via chlorination and chlorine removal, allowing rewritable graphene photodetectors to be fabricated./ [Rho, Yoonsoo; Wang, Letian; Pei, Jiayun; Grigoropoulos, Costas P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Laser Thermal Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lee, Kyunghoon] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ko, Changhyun; Chen, Yabin; Ci, Penghong; Wu, Junqiao] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ko, Changhyun] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Seoul, South Korea; [Chen, Yabin] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Aerosp Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ci, Penghong] Shenzhen Univ, Inst Adv Study, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Pei, Jiayun] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zettl, Alex] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy Nanosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√à University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Sookmyung Women's University; Beijing Institute of Technology; Shenzhen University; Tsinghua University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeleyy  Grigoropoulos, CP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Laser Thermal Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  cgrigoro@berkeley.edu0  Wu, Junqiao/G-7840-2011; Zettl, Alex/O-4925-2016√ì  Wu, Junqiao/0000-0002-1498-0148; Lee, Kyunghoon/0000-0002-3409-9454; Wang, Letian/0000-0002-1983-5150; Zettl, Alex/0000-0001-6330-136X; Ci, Penghong/0000-0001-5949-6854; Grigoropoulos, Costas/0000-0002-8505-4037√≥  US National Science Foundation [CMMI-1662475, CMMI-2024391]; Samsung Research Global Outreach; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KCWF16] US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Samsung Research Global Outreach; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))t We thank S.

An archetype contains stacked 2D layers, the structure of which features a fully annulated aromatic skeleton with embedded heteroatoms and periodic pores. Due to the lack of a rational approach in establishing in-plane order under mild synthetic conditions, the structural integrity of PGF has remained elusive and ultimately limited its material performance. Here, we report the discovery of the unusual dynamic character of the C=N bonds in the aromatic pyrazine ring system under basic aqueous conditions, which enables the successful synthesis of a crystalline porous nitrogenous graphitic framework with remarkable in-plane order, as evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction studies and direct visualization using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The crystalline framework displays superior performance as a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries, outperforming the amorphous counterparts in terms of capacity and cycle stability.A [Li, Xinle; Liu, Yawei; Cai, Songliang; Sun, Bing; Dun, Chaochao; Gordon, Madeleine P.;<     Urban, Jeffrey J.; Ciston, Jim; Chan, Emory M.; Zhang, Jian; Liu, Yi] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Qi; Zhang, Qiubo; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mao, Haiyan; Reimer, Jeffrey A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Environm Energy Technol Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Hongxia; Chen, Hao] Stanford Univ, Dept Mat & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mao, Haiyan; Reimer, Jeffrey A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cai, Songliang] South China Normal Univ, Sch Chem & Environm, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Sun, Bing] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Tan, Tianwei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Natl Energy R&D Ctr Biorefinery, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Mao, Haiyan] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; South China Normal University; China University of Geosciences; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Nanjing Forestry Universityi  Zhang, J; Liu, Y (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  jianzhang@lbl.gov; yliu@lbl.govs  Zhang, Jian/M-9978-2019; Liu, yi/A-3384-2008; Sun, Bing/G-8210-2017; Sun, Bing/AGF-5285-2022; Li, Xinle/B-8285-2016√Ä√Ω√ø√ø√ø              	

Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of deterministic GNR quantum dots whose orbital character is defined by zero-mode states arising from nontrivial topological interfaces. Topological control was achieved through the synthesis and on-surface assembly of three distinct molecular precursors designed to exhibit structurally derived topological electronic states. Using a combination of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we have characterized two GNR topological quantum dot arrangements synthesized under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Our results are supported by density-functional theory and tight-binding calculations, revealing that the magnitude and sign of orbital hopping between topological zero-mode states can be tuned based on the bonding geometry of the interconnecting region. These results demonstrate the utility of topological zero modes as components for designer quantum dots and advanced electronic devices.W [Rizzo, Daniel J.; Jiang, Jingwei; Bronner, Christopher; Jacobse, Peter H.; Cao, Ting; Rodriguez, Henry; Butler, Paul; Chen, Ting; Louie, Steven G.; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rizzo, Daniel J.] Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Jiang, Jingwei; Louie, Steven G.; Fischer, Felix R.; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Joshi, Dharati; Veber, Gregory; Durr, Rebecca A.; Kalayjian, Alin; Fischer, Felix R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cao, Ting] Univ Washington, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Fischer, Felix R.; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fischer, Felix R.; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬Ω University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Columbia University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Louie, SG; Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Louie, SG; Fischer, FR; Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Fischer, FR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Fischer, FR; Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Fischer, FR; Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.A  sglouie@berkeley.edu; ffischer@berkeley.edu; crommie@berkeley.edu  Cao, Ting/GPC-5837-2022d  Cao, Ting/0000-0003-1300-6084; Rizzo, Daniel/0000-0003-4587-4863; Jiang, Jingwei/0000-0002-0949-4401¬∑ US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KC1203]; Office of Naval Research [N00014-19-1-2503]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1839098, DMR-1926004]; Dutch Research Council (NWO) [019.182E<   N.18]; Frontera computing project at the Texas Advanced Computing Center [OAC-1818253]; Office of Naval Research under MURI Program [N00014-19-1-2596]√ú US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Frontera computing project at the Texas Advanced Computing Center; Office of Naval Research under MURI Program. This work was funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

TSks have topological charge 1 or 0, if the z component of the magnetization M-z goes through a rotation of n pi where n is an odd or even integer, respectively. TSks with a rotation of the z component of up to 4 pi have been imaged via high spatial resolution element-specific x-ray imaging. The TSks were generated by weakly coupling 30 nm thin Permalloy (Ni80Fe20, PY) disks with a 1 mu m diameter to asymmetric (Ir 1 nm/Co 1.5 nm/Pt 1 nm) x 7 multilayers that exhibit Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The PY disks stabilize the TSks in the multilayers due to reduced stray field energy and enforced circular symmetry from pinning of domain walls at the edges of the disks. Upon applying external magnetic fields, it is the skyrmion core at the center that ensures stability of the TSk, whereas the collapse of the extended structures in the TSk does not depend on the topological charge.; [Kent, Noah; Streubel, Robert; Je, Soong-Gun; Im, Mi-Young; Hellman, Frances; Fischer, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kent, Noah; Fischer, Peter] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Phys Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Lambert, Charles-Henri] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mat, Honggerbergring 64, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lambert, Charles-Henri; Salahuddin, Sayeef] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 2626 Hearst Ave, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ceballos, Alejandro; Hellman, Frances] Univ Calif Berkeley, Phys Dept, 366 LeConte Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Je, Soong-Gun; Im, Mi-Young] DGIST, Dept Emerging Mat Sci, 333 Techno Jungang Daero, Dalseong Gun 711873, Daegu, South Korea; [Dhuey, Scott] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Im, Mi-Young] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Phys Sch Mat Sci & Engn, KIST UNIST Ulan Ctr Convergent Mat, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Buttner, Felix] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 182 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USAK United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology (DGIST); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)√†  Fischer, P (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Fischer, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Phys Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.  PJFischer@lbl.govp  Fischer, Peter/U-5337-2019; Streubel, Robert/D-9686-2012; Fischer, Peter/A-3020-2010; B√ºttner, Felix/J-9286-2012¬∞  Fischer, Peter/0000-0002-9824-9343; Streubel, Robert/0000-0003-4783-892X; Fischer, Peter/0000-0002-9824-9343; B√ºttner, Felix/0000-0002-6204-9948; Kent, Noah/0000-0003-2712-6239L U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the NEMM program (MSMAG) [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; DOE Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; E3S center - National Science Foundation; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea - Ministry of Education, Science and ICT [2018K1A4A3A03075584, 2016M3D1A1027831]; DGIST R&D program of the Ministry of Science, ICT and future Planning [18-BT-02]Z U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the NEMM program (MSMAG)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); E3S center - National Science Foundation; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea - Ministry of Education, Science and ICT; DGIST R&D program of the Ministry of Science, ICT and future Planning¬° This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the NEMM program (MSMAG).; The work at the Molecular Foundry was supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.; This research used resources of the Advanced Light Source, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.; The material synthesis was supported by the E3S center supported by the National Science Foundation.; M.-Y.

The rational design of these OSDAs often entails the identification of molecules with a geometry that is commensurate with the channels and cages of the target zeolite structure. Syntheses tend to employ only a single OSDA, but there are a few examples where two or more organics operate synergistically to yield a desired product. Using a combination of state-of-the-art characterization techniques and molecular modeling, we show that the coupling of N,N,N-trimethyl-1,1-adamantammonium and 1,2-hexanediol, each yielding distinct zeolites when used alone, results in the cooperative direction of a third structure, HOU-4, with the mordenite framework type (MOR). Rietveld refinement using synchrotron X-ray diffraction data reveals the spatial arrangement of the organics in the HOU-4 crystals, with amines located in the large channels and alcohols oriented in the side pockets lining the one-dimensional pores. These results are in excellent agreement with molecular dynamics calculations, which predict similar spatial distributions of organics with an energetically favorable packing density that agrees with experimental measurements of OSDA loading, as well as with solid-state two-dimensional Al-27{(29)si}, Al-27{H-1}, and C-13{H-1} NMR correlation spectra, which establish the proximities and interactions of occluded OSDAs. A combination of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy is used to quantify the size of the HOU-4 crystals, which exhibit a platelike morphology, and to index the crystal facets. Our findings reveal that the combined OSDAs work in tandem to produce ultrathin, nonfaulted HOU-4 crystals that exhibit improved catalytic activity for cumene cracking in comparison to mordenite crystals prepared via conventional syntheses. This novel demonstration of cooperativity highlights the potential possibilities for expanding the use of dual structure-directing agents in zeolite synthesis.‚Äû [Kumar, Manjesh; Clark, R.

A dense twinned structure in conjunction with a high dislocation density significantly reduces the converse piezoelectric effect of BaTiO3 by hindering the propagation of newly nucleated domains with an applied electric field. This, in turn, results in a modest reduction of the PMA of the ferromagnetic layer. On the other hand, the ferroelectric polarization reorients from [100] to [001] direction in a dislocation-free BaTiO3, inducing the maximum achievable in-plane compressive strain of 1.1%. A large fraction of this uniaxial strain is transferred to the magnetoelastically coupled ferromagnetic layers whose magnetization switches to in plane via the inverse magnetostriction effect. This work reveals the critical role of the interplay between twin walls and dislocations within a ferroelectric substrate in the performance of multiferroic heterostructures and provides insight into the development of highly energy-efficient magnetoelectric devices.k [Goiriena-Goikoetxea, M.; El-Ghazaly, A.; Chatterjee, J.; Pattabi, A.; Lo Conte, R.; Bokor, J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Goiriena-Goikoetxea, M.] Univ Basque Country, Dept Elect & Elect, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Xiao, Z.; Candler, R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Xiao, Z.; Stan, C., V; Tamura, N.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Stan, C., V] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, NIF & Photon Sci, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Ceballos, A.; Hellman, F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ceballos, A.; Hellman, F.; Bokor, J.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hellman, F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Candler, R.] Calif NanoSyst Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA# University <    of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Basque Country; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√£  Goiriena-Goikoetxea, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Goiriena-Goikoetxea, M (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Dept Elect & Elect, Leioa 48940, Spain.  maite.goiriena@ehu.eus  Tamura, Nobumichi/D-7410-2012√Å  Tamura, Nobumichi/0000-0002-3698-2611; Stan, Camelia/0000-0002-5025-5568; Lo Conte, Roberto/0000-0002-5050-9978; Goiriena-Goikoetxea, Maite/0000-0001-8419-9499; Xiao, Zhuyun/0000-0002-7244-8635E NSF Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Translational Applications of the Nanoscale Multiferroic Systems (TANMS) [EEC-1160504]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Nonequilibrium Magnetic Materials Program (MSMAG) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation Center for Energy Efficient Electronics Science; Basque Government≈í NSF Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Translational Applications of the Nanoscale Multiferroic Systems (TANMS); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Nonequilibrium Magnetic Materials Program (MSMAG)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation Center for Energy Efficient Electronics Science; Basque Government(Basque Government)f This work was supported by the NSF Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Translational Applications of the Nanoscale Multiferroic Systems (TANMS) under Cooperative Agreement Award No. EEC-1160504.

However, one major problem is the difficulty of identifying which materials from a synthesis paragraph are precursors or are target materials. In this study, we developed a two-step chemical named entity recognition model to identify precursors and targets, based on information from the context around material entities. Using the extracted data, we conducted a meta-analysis to study the similarities and differences between precursors in the context of solid-state synthesis. To quantify precursor similarity, we built a substitution model to calculate the viability of substituting one precursor with another while retaining the target. From a hierarchical clustering of the precursors, we demonstrate that the chemical similarity of precursors can be extracted from text data. Quantifying the similarity of precursors helps provide a foundation for suggesting candidate reactants in a predictive synthesis model.y¬¶ [He, Tanjin; Huo, Haoyan; Kononova, Olga; Ceder, Gerbrand] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [He, Tanjin; Sun, Wenhao; Huo, Haoyan; Kononova, Olga; Rong, Ziqin; Ceder, Gerbrand] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tshitoyan, Vahe] Google LLC, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Botari, Tiago] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Math & Comp Sci, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil¬Æ  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Universidade de Sao Pauloe  Ceder, Gerbrand/0000-0001-9275-3605; Huo, Haoyan/0000-0003-2227-9121; Sun, Wenhao/0000-0002-8416-455X Energy & Biosciences Institute through the EBI-Shell program [PT74140, PT78473]; Assistant Secretary of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Vehicle Technologies Office, U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Naval Research (ONR) [N00014-16-1-2432]; National Science Foundation [ACI-1548562, 1922311, 1922372, 1922090]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; UC Berkeley; NSF [ACI-1445606]2 Energy & Biosciences Institute through the EBI-Shell program; Assistant Secretary of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Vehicle Technologies Office, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Naval Research (ONR)(Office of Naval Research); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); UC Berkeley; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))7 Funding to support this work was provided by the Energy & Biosciences Institute through the EBI-Shell program (award nos.

However, the vdW interlayer interaction is intrinsically weak, such that many desired properties can only exist at low temperature. Here, we theoretically predict some unusual properties stemming from the chemical bonding between twisted PbS nanosheets as an example of non-vdW moire superlattices. The strong interlayer coupling in such systems results in giant strain vortices and dipole vortices at the interface. The modified electronic structures become a series of dispersionless bands and artificial-atom states. In real space, these states are analogous to arrays of well-positioned quantum dots, which may be promising for use in single-electron devices. In theory, if the materials are doped with a low concentration of electrons, a Wigner crystal will form even without any magnetic field. To confirm the accessibility and stability of non-vdW moire superlattices in experiment, we synthesized PbS moire superlattices with different twist angles. Our transmission-electron-microscope observations reveal the resemblance of the small-angle-twisted structures with the square matrices of quantum dots, which is in good accordance with our calculations. [Song, Zhigang; Narang, Prineha] Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wang, Yu] South China Univ Technol, South China Adv Inst Soft Matter Sci & Technol, Sch Emergent Soft Matter, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Lin-Wang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Semicond, State Key Lab Superlatt & Microstruct, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China Harvard University; South China University of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Semiconductors, CAS√∂  Narang, P (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Wang, LW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Semicond, State Key Lab Superlatt & Microstruct, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.+  prineha@seas.harvard.edu; lwwang@semi.ac.cnG  wang, lin/GSE-3040-2022; wang, lili/HDL-7210-2022; Wang, Yu/D-7308-2017ÀÜ  Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Wang, Yu/0000-0002-9029-1846; Narang, Prineha/0000-0003-3956-4594; Wang, Lin-Wang/0000-0001-7061-2692 Office of Naval Research (ONR) MURI Program [ONR N00014-21-1-2537]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [FWP ERKCK47]; Army Research Office MURI (Ab Initio Solid-State Quantum Materials) Grant [W911NF-18-1-0431]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; NSF CAREER Award [NSF-ECCS-1944085]; DOE, Office of Science, Office of BES, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program [415 DE-AC02-05CH11231];  [GBMF8048]N Office of Naval Research (ONR) MURI Program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Army Research Office MURI (Ab Initio Solid-State Quantum Materials) Grant; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); NSF CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); DOE, Office of Science, Office of BES, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); √º This work is partially supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) MURI Program under Grant NO.

Superconductivity is observed proximate to a metallic state with reduced isospin symmetry, but it remains unknown whether this is a coincidence or a key ingredient for superconductivity. Using a Hartree-Fock analysis and constraints from experiments, we argue that the symmetry breaking is inter-valley coherent (IVC) in nature. We evaluate IVC fluctuations as a possible pairing glue, and find that they lead to chiral unconventional superconductivity when the fluctuations are strong. We further elucidate how the inter-valley Hund's coupling determines the spin-structure of the IVC ground state and breaks the degeneracy between spin-singlet and triplet superconductivity. Remarkably, if the normal state is spin-unpolarized, we find that a ferromagnetic Hund's coupling favors spin-singlet superconductivity, in agreement with experiments. Instead, if the normal state is spin-polarized, then IVC fluctuations lead to spin-triplet pairing. Trilayer graphene was recently shown to exhibit superconductivity without a Moire pattern that had proved important in tuning superconductivity in bilayer graphene. Here, the authors explore correlated metallic phases and the pairing mechanism of superconductivity in trilayer graphene, and show that intervalley coherent fluctuations can act as a pairing glue, giving rise to chiral unconventional superconductivity.) [Chatterjee, Shubhayu; Wang, Taige; Zaletel, Michael P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Taige; Zaletel, Michael P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Berg, Erez] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Condensed Matter Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel¬≤  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Weizmann Institute of Science]  Chatterjee, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  shubhayuchatterjee@berkeley.edui  Chatterjee, Shubhayu/0000-0001-9599-8456; Berg, Erez/0000-0001-8956-3384; Wang, Taige/0000-0001-7227-915X¬µ ARO through the MURI program [W911NF-17-1-0323]; U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, under the Accelerated Research in Quantum Computing (ARQC) program; U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science<    s, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KCWF16]; European Research Council (ERC) under grant HQMAT [817799]; Israel-USA Binational Science Foundation (BSF) ARO through the MURI program; U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, under the Accelerated Research in Quantum Computing (ARQC) program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); European Research Council (ERC) under grant HQMAT(European Research Council (ERC)); Israel-USA Binational Science Foundation (BSF)(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation)] We thank A.

Here an effective and reliable method of increasing the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 vdW materials by Ga implantation is reported. It is found that implanting Ga into Fe3GeTe2 by the amount of 10(-3) Ga angstrom(-3) could greatly enhance the Fe3GeTe2 Curie temperature by almost 100%. Spatially resolved microdiffraction and element-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy show little changes in the Fe3GeTe2 crystal structure and Fe valence state. In addition, the Ga implantation changes the Fe3GeTe2 magnetization from out-of-plane direction at low temperature to in-plane direction at high temperature. The result opens a new opportunity for tailoring the magnetic properties of vdW materials beyond room temperature.√¶ [Yang, Mengmeng; Li, Qian; Wang, Sheng; Wang, Tianye; Gao, Nan; Wang, Feng; Qiu, Ziqiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chopdekar, Rajesh, V; Stan, Camelia; Cabrini, Stefano; Scholl, Andreas; Tamura, Nobumichi] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source & Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Choi, Jun Woo] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Spintron, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Hwang, Chanyong] Korea Res Inst Stand & Sci, Yuseong 305340, Daejeon, South Korea√º  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea Research Institute of Standards & Science (KRISS)^  Li, Q; Qiu, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.)  qianli2015@berkeley.edu; qiu@berkeley.eduo  Tamura, Nobumichi/D-7410-2012; Scholl, Andreas/K-4876-2012; Wang, Sheng/AAW-9030-2020; Qiu, Z.

Here, the interfacial assembly and transition of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (H6TPPS) over time provides an opportunity to monitor the interfacial behavior of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) during all-liquid printing. The formation of J-aggregates of H4TPPS2- at the interface and the interfacial conversion of the J-aggregates of H4TPPS2- to H-aggregates of H2TPPS4- is demonstrated by interfacial rheology and in situ atomic force microscopy. Equally important are the chromogenic changes that are characteristic of the state of aggregation, where J-aggregates are green in color an<    d H-aggregates are red in color. In all-liquid 3D printed structures, the conversion in the aggregate state with time is reflected in a spatially varying change in the color, providing a simple, direct means of assessing the aggregation state of the molecules and the mechanical properties of the assemblies, linking a macroscopic observable (color) to mechanical properties.¬∫ [Gu, Pei-Yang; Chen, Qun] Changzhou Univ, Sch Petrochem Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Adv Catalyt Mat & Technol, Changzhou 213164, Peoples R China; [Gu, Pei-Yang; Xu, Qing-Feng; Lu, Jian-Mei] Soochow Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Gu, Pei-Yang; Kim, Paul Y.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ashby, Paul D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Feng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr IFSA CICIFSA, Dept Phys & Astron, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China∆í Changzhou University; Soochow University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; City University of Hong Kong; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Beijing University of Chemical Technology≈ì Chen, Q (corresponding author), Changzhou Univ, Sch Petrochem Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Adv Catalyt Mat & Technol, Changzhou 213164, Peoples R China.;Lu, JM (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.B  chenqunjpu@yahoo.com; lujm@suda.edu.cn; russell@mail.pse.umass.edu‚Ä†  Chen, Qun/HGD-0868-2022; Liu, Feng/J-4361-2014; gu, peiyang/HJH-4059-2023; Russell, Thomas Paul/ADL-3689-2022; Kim, Paul/GYV-3258-2022‚Äû  Liu, Feng/0000-0002-5572-8512; Russell, Thomas Paul/0000-0001-6384-5826; Kim, Paul/0000-0003-0943-4924; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321@ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCTR16]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy; Army Research Office [W911NF-20-0093]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21938006, 51803143]; National Key Technology Research and Development Program [2020YFC1818401]; Basic Research Project of Leading Technology in Jiangsu Province [BK20202012]¬ç U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring Liquids program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Army Research Office; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Technology Research and Development Program(National Key Technology R&D Program); Basic Research Project of Leading Technology in Jiangsu Province√ê P.-Y.G. and P.Y.K. contributed equally to this work.

Due to their versatile composition, it is possible to fine-tune the perovskite's properties. We present a method for the rational design of AMO(3-) perovskite solid solutions with two different species on the Msite in order to tune their redox behavior. To account for the different ionic radii of different transition metal species M, two distinct ions are used in a solid solution on the A site, allowing tolerance-factor adjusted materials design. Using this methodology, we can create stable perovskites over a large range of different compositions. Leveraging the infrastructure of Materials Project, we calculate redox enthalpies for the reduction of over 240 of these perovskites to their brownmillerite phases based on density functional theory (DFT). We compare this data to experimentally measured data on thermodynamics of 24 of these materials to verify our theoretical framework. An empirical model is formulated for predicting the enthalpy and entropy changes as a function of the perovskites non-stoichiometry , which can be used to simulate the equilibrium composition as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure and to create a perovskite search engine based on an energetic analysis of the redox cycles. The data has been added as a contribution to MPContribs, which now includes publicly available user-controlled interactive graphs based on our theoretical and experimental data.f [Vieten, Josua; Guban, Dorottya; Roeb, Martin; Sattler, Christian] German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Solar Res, D-51147 Cologne, Germany; [Vieten, Josua; Sattler, Christian] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Mech Sci & Engn, Inst Power Engn, Solar Fuel Prod, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Bulfin, Brendan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Renewable Energy Carriers, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Huck, Patrick; Horton, Matthew; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA USA; [Zhu, Liya; Lu, Youjun] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Multiphase Flow Power Engn SKLMF, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China√ª  Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Technische Universitat Dresden; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Xi'an Jiaotong University√§  Vieten, J (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Solar Res, D-51147 Cologne, Germany.;Vieten, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Mech Sci & Engn, Inst Power Engn, Solar Fuel Prod, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.  Josua.Vieten@dlr.de]  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Lu, Youjun/O-4256-2014; Sattler, Christian/A-7860-2012K  Sattler,<     Christian/0000-0002-4314-1124; Bulfin, Brendan/0000-0001-9361-0075G Helmholtz Association within the Virtual Institute SolarSyngas [VH-VI-509]; project DuSOL - state of Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany [EFRE-0800603]; project DuSOL - European EFRE fund [EFRE-0800603]; China Scholarships Council; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]; Computational Materials Sciences Program - DOE, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-SC0014607]; Office of Science of the DOE [DE-AC02-05CH1123]s Helmholtz Association within the Virtual Institute SolarSyngas(Helmholtz Association); project DuSOL - state of Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany; project DuSOL - European EFRE fund; China Scholarships Council; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Computational Materials Sciences Program - DOE, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√ß The authors would like to acknowledge valuable ideas provided by Dr Joseph Montoya (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) for the calculation of elastic properties and the heat capacity.

Surface adsorbates that are selectively attached to certain facets may strongly affect the atomic pathways of nanocrystal shape development. However, it is a great challenge to directly observe such dynamic processes in situ with a high spatial resolution. Here, we report the anomalous shape evolution of Ag2O2 nanocrystals modulated by the surface adsorbates of Ag clusters during electron beam etching, which is revealed through in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In contrast to the Ag2O2 nanocrystals without adsorbates, which display the near-equilibrium shape throughout the etching process, Ag2O2 nanocrystals with Ag surface adsorbates show distinct facet development during etching by electron beam irradiation. Three stages of shape changes are observed: a sphere-to-a cube transformation, side etching of a cuboid, and bottom etching underneath the surface adsorbates. We find that the Ag adsorbates modify the Ag2O2 nanocrystal surface configuration by selectively capping the junction between two neighboring facets. They prevent the edge atoms from being etched away and block the diffusion path of surface atoms. Our findings provide critical insights into the modulatory function of surface adsorbates on the shape control of nanocrystals.¬£ [Zhang, Qiubo; Shen, Yuting; Dong, Hui; Sun, Litao] Southeast Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Micro Nano Fabricat Device, Key Lab MEMS, SEU FEI Nano Pico Ctr,Minist Educ, Nanjing 210018, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiubo; Gao, Guoping; Peng, Xinxing; Shangguan, Junyi; Wang, Yu; Wang, Linwang; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shen, Yuting] Changshu Inst Technol, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Changshu 215500, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bustillo, Karen] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA$ Southeast University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Changshu Institute of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley‚Äû Sun, LT (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Micro Nano Fabricat Device, Key Lab MEMS, SEU FEI Nano Pico Ctr,Minist Educ, Nanjing 210018, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  slt@seu.edu.cn; hmzheng@lbl.govz  Gao, Guoping/W-2417-2019; Peng, Xinxing/U-4102-2019; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Wang, Yu/D-7308-2017; Sun, Litao/D-4289-2013¬§  Gao, Guoping/0000-0002-6106-7423; Wang, Yu/0000-0002-9029-1846; Peng, Xinxing/0000-0002-7077-8454; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Sun, Litao/0000-0002-2750-5004√ß U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC22ZH]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51420105003, 11327901, 11525415, 11674052]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; China Scholarship Council [201606090071]; Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University [YBPY1708] U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University% This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

Most commonly, energy bands are computed along a one-dimensional path of high-symmetry points and line segments in reciprocal space (the k-path), which are assumed to pass through important features of the dispersion landscape. However, existing methods for choosing this path rely on tabulated lists of high-symmetry points and line segments in the first Brillouin zone, determined using different symmetry criteria and unit cell conventions. Here we present a new on-the-fly symmetry-based approach to obtaining paths in reciprocal space that attempt√Ω√ø√ø√ø‚Äö  ∆í  ‚Äû  ‚Ä¶  ‚Ä†  ‚Ä°  ÀÜ  ‚Ä∞  ≈†  ‚Äπ  ≈í  ¬ç  ≈Ω  ¬è  ¬ê  ‚Äò  ‚Äô  ‚Äú  ‚Äù  ‚Ä¢  ‚Äì  ‚Äî  Àú  ‚Ñ¢  ≈°  ‚Ä∫  ≈ì  ¬ù  ≈æ  ≈∏  ¬†  ¬°  ¬¢  ¬£  ¬§  ¬•  ¬¶  ¬ß  ¬®  ¬©  ¬™  ¬´  ¬¨  ¬≠  ¬Æ  ¬Ø  ¬∞  ¬±  ¬≤  ¬≥  ¬¥  ¬µ  ¬∂  ¬∑  ¬∏  ¬π  ¬∫  ¬ª  ¬º  ¬Ω  ¬æ  ¬ø  √Ä  √Å  √Ç  √É  √Ñ  √Ö  √Ü  √á  √à  √â  √ä  √ã  √å  √ç  √é  √è  √ê  √ë  √í  √ì  √î  √ï  √ñ  √ó  √ò  √ô  √ö  √õ  √ú  √ù  √û  √ü  √†  √°  √¢  √£  √§  √•  √¶  √ß  √®  √©  √™  √´  √¨  √≠  √Æ  √Ø  √∞  √±  √≤  √≥  √¥  √µ  √∂  √∑  √∏  √π  √∫  √ª  √º  √Ω  √æ  √ø  	  s to address the previous limitations of these conventions. Given a unit cell of a magnetic or nonmagnetic periodic solid, the site symmetry groups of points and line segments in the irreducible Brillouin zone are obtained from the total space group. The elements in these groups are used alongside general and maximally inclusive high-symmetry criteria to choose segments for the final k-path. A smooth path connecting each segment is obtained using graph theory. This new framework not only allows for increased flexibility and user convenience but also identifies notable overlooked features in certain electronic band structures. In addition, a more intelligent and efficient method for analyzing magnetic materials is also enabled through proper accommodation of magnetic symmetry.3 [Munro, Jason M.; Horton, Matthew K.; Dwaraknath, Shyam; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Latimer, Katherine] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ã  Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  kristinpersson@berkeley.edus  Dwaraknath, Shyam/0000-0003-0289-2607; Munro, Jason M./0000-0002-3047-0367; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509√û  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]	 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE)) The authors acknowledge support by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (Materials Project program KC23MP).

Drawing an analogy between electrons and photons, artificially designed optical lattices indicate the possibility of a similar band modulation effect in graphene systems. Yet due to the fermionic nature of electrons, modulated electronic systems promise far richer categories of behaviors than those found in optical lattices. Here, we uncovered a strong modulation of electronic states in bilayer graphene subject to periodic potentials. We observed for the first time the hybridization of electron and hole sub-bands, resulting in local band gaps at both primary and secondary charge neutrality points. Such hybridization leads to the formation of flat bands, enabling the study of correlated effects in graphene systems. This work may provide a novel way to manipulate electronic states in layered systems, which is important to both fundamental research and application.A [Wang, Siqi; Zhao, Mervin; Yang, Sui; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr NSEC, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Siqi; Zhao, Mervin; Yang, Sui; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiang] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Changjian; Hone, James] Columbia Univ, Dept Mech Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Watanabe, Kenji; Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Zhang, Xiang] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiang] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China' National Science Foundation (NSF); University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Columbia University; National Institute for Materials Science; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong Zhang, X (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr NSEC, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zhang, X (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zhang, X (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zhang, X (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.  xzhang@me.berkeley.edu‚Äπ  Zhang, Xiang/F-6905-2011; Wang, Yuan/F-7211-2011; Wang, Yuan/HHC-1520-2022; wangwangwang, yuanyaun/HHN-6432-2022; Hone, James C/E-1879-2011‚Ä¶  Wang, Yuan/0000-0001-7892-2812; Hone, James C/0000-0002-8084-3301; Zhao, Mervin/0000-0002-7313-7150; Zhang, Xiang/0000-0002-3272-894X9 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the van der Waals Heterostructures Program [KCWF16, DEAC02-05-CH11231]; National Science Foundation (NSF) MRI grant [1725335]; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research award [OSR-2016-CRG5-2996]; NSF [EFMA-1741660]; Elemental Strategy Initiative by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) [JPMJCR15F3]7 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the van der Waals Heterostructures Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation (NSF) MRI grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research award(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Elemental Strategy Initiative by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST))k S.W., M.Z., S.Y., Y.W. and X.Z. acknowledge the support from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the van der Waals Heterostructures Program (KCWF16) under contract No. DEAC02-05-CH11231 for sample preparation, the support from the Nationa<    l Science Foundation (NSF) MRI grant 1725335 for low-temperature measurement, and the support from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research award OSR-2016-CRG5-2996 for sample fabrication.

Starting from a consideration of the octahedral and tolerance factors of similar to 2000 candidate double perovskite compounds, we compute structural, electronic, and transport properties of similar to 1000 using first-principles calculations based on density-functional-theory methods. The computational results have been assembled in a database that is accessible through the Materials Project online. As one potential application, double perovskites are candidates in the search for lead-free halide photovoltaic absorbers. We present the application of our database to aid the discovery of new double perovskite halide photovoltaic materials, by combining the results with optical absorption and phonon stability calculations. From three distinct classes of chemistries, 11 compounds were identified as promising solar absorbers and the complex chemical trends for band gap within each of these are analyzed, to provide guidelines for the use of substitutional alloying as a means of further tuning the electronic structure. Other possible applications of the database are also discussed.¬∞ [Cai, Yao; Xie, Wei; Persson, Kristin A.; Sherburne, Matthew; Asta, Mark] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Teng, Yin Ting; Harikesh, P.

Recent studies show, however, that there can be large variabilities in the mechanical performance of these alloys, particularly in their toughness, which are likely associated with sample-size effects or structural variations from differences in processing. Here, we examine the variation in fracture toughness of the Pd-based metallic glass Pd77.5Cu6Si16.5, using single-edge notched bend specimens but in two different sizes. Although all toughness results on this glass were valid in terms of the nonlinear elastic fracture mechanics J-standard, i.e., one would expect a single value of the fracture toughness for this alloy, marked differences were apparent in the toughness values and failure characteristics of the differently-sized samples. Specifically, significantly larger variations in toughness values were measured in larger-sized samples, which all essentially failed catastrophically, whereas none of the smaller-sized samples failed catastrophically yet displayed far less scatter in their measured toughness. Additional in situ tests on the smaller-sized samples in a scanning electron microscope revealed stable crack growth and progressive resistance to crack extension, i.e., rising crack-resistance (R-curve) behavior. Overall, this marked transition from brittle catastrophic failure in larg<    e samples, where a size-independent fracture toughness can be measured, to non-catastrophic, more ductile (R-curve), behavior in smaller samples, the latter associated with higher toughness, is related to the distinct size-dependent bending ductility and strain-softening behavior in BMGs.

Exceptions include materials exhibiting twinning-induced plasticity. To understand how the strength-ductility trade-off can be defeated, we apply in situ, and aberration-corrected scanning, transmission electron microscopy to examine deformation mechanisms in the medium-entropy alloy CrCoNi that exhibits one of the highest combinations of strength, ductility and toughness on record. Ab initio modelling suggests that it has negative stacking-fault energy at 0K and high propensity for twinning. With deformation we find that a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical twin network forms from the activation of three twinning systems. This serves a dual function: conventional twin-boundary (TB) strengthening from blockage of dislocations impinging on TBs, coupled with the 3D twin network which offers pathways for dislocation glide along, and cross-slip between, intersecting TB-matrix interfaces. The stable twin architecture is not disrupted by interfacial dislocation glide, serving as a continuous source of strength, ductility and toughness.M [Zhang, Zijiao; Zhang, Ze; Yu, Qian; Mao, Scott X.] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Electron Microscopy, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zijiao; Zhang, Ze; Yu, Qian; Mao, Scott X.] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Hongwei] George Mason Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Wang, Zhangjie] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Gludovatz, Bernd; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [George, Easo P.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Mat Sci & Technol Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Mao, Scott X.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA‚Äô Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; George Mason University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of California System; University of California BerkeleyQ Yu, Q; Mao, SX (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Electron Microscopy, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Yu, Q; Mao, SX (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Mao, SX (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.4  yu_qian@zju.edu.cn; sxm2@pitt.edu; roritchie@lbl.govp  George, Easo P/L-5434-2014; Ritchie, Robert O/A-8066-2008; Gludovatz, Bernd/O-2121-2014; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019¬∑  George, Easo P/0000-0001-9898-9694; Ritchie, Robert O/0000-0002-0501-6998; Gludovatz, Bernd/0000-0002-2420-3879; Sheng, Howard/0000-0002-6134-0354; Cheng, Hui-Ming/0000-0002-5387-4241≈Ω Chinese 1000-Youth-Talent Plan; State Key Program for Basic Research in China [2015CB65930]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division through the Materials Science and Technology Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division through the Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NSF [DMR-1611064]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√´ Chinese 1000-Youth-Talent Plan; State Key Program for Basic Research in China; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division through the Materials Science and Technology Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division through the Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Program (KC13) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))H This work was supported by the Chinese 1000-Youth-Talent Plan (for Q.Y.) and the State Key Program for Basic Research in China under Grant No. 2015CB65930 (for Z.Z., Z.W., Z.Z. & S.X.M.), and by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division through the Materials Science and Technology Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (for E.P.G.) and through the Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Program (KC13) under contract no.

More than that, in this work, by employing a trove of first-principles data of TM oxides, the local structures of TM cations are statistically analyzed to extract detailed information about cation site preference, bond length, site structural distortion, and cation magnetization. It is found that cation radius alone poorly describes the local structure of a transition metal oxide, while the statistics of coordination number as well as the TM-O bond length distribution, especially that of the 3d TMs, can provide comprehensive knowledge for understanding the behavior of TM elements. Based on these statistics, the interplay of site distortion due to the Jahn-Teller effect, cation site similarity, and a new set of ionic radii are all obtained to chart the persona of transition metal ions in solids.c [Jia, Huaxian; Wang, Yanan; Zhang, Shengjie; Meng, Sheng; Liu, Miao] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Natl Lab Condensed Matter Phys, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Jia, Huaxian; Wang, Yanan; Zhang, Shengjie; Meng, Sheng; Liu, Miao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Phys, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Jia, Huaxian; Zhang, Shengjie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Phys Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Jia, Huaxian; Wang, Yanan; Meng, Sheng; Liu, Miao] Songshan Lake Mat Lab, Dongguan 523808, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Horton, Matthew] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Miao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Mat Sci & Optoelect Engn, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China√∑ Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS‚Äù Meng, S; Liu, M (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Natl Lab Condensed Matter Phys, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Meng, S; Liu, M (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Phys, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Meng, S; Liu, M (corresponding author), Songshan Lake Mat Lab, Dongguan 523808, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Liu, M (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Mat Sci & Optoelect Engn, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.4  kapersson@lbl.gov; smeng@iphy.ac.cn; mliu@iphy.ac.cn  ; Liu, Miao/N-9937-2013?

However, the synthesis of unusual crystal phases of noble metals still remains a great challenge, making the construction of heterophase noble metal nanostructures difficult. Here, we report a one-pot wet-chemical synthesis of well-defined heterophase fcc-2H-fcc gold nanorods (fcc: face-centred cubic; 2H: hexagonal close-packed with stacking sequence of AB) at mild conditions. Single particle-level experiments and theoretical investigations reveal that the heterophase gold nanorods demonstrate a distinct optical property compared to that of the conventional fcc gold nanorods. Moreover, the heterophase gold nanorods possess superior electrocatalytic activity for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction over their fcc counterparts under ambient conditions. First-principles calculations suggest that the boosted catalytic performance stems from the energetically favourable adsorption of reaction intermediates, endowed by the unique heterophase characteristic of gold nanorods. The crystal phase-based heterostructures of noble metal nanomaterials are of interest for various applications. Here, the authors report the wet-chemical synthesis of gold nanorods with a well-defined fcc-2H-fcc heterophase, which possess unique optical and catalytic properties.√µ [Fan, Zhanxi; Huang, Zhiqi; Ling, Chongyi; Zhang, Hua] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Chem, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fan, Zhanxi; Zhang, Hua] City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong Branch, Natl Precious Met Mat Engn Res Ctr NPMM, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fan, Zhanxi; Chen, Ye; Chen, Bo; Zhang, Jian; Ge, Yiyao; Zhang, Zhicheng; Niu, Wenxin] Nanyang Technol Univ, Ctr Programmable Mat, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Fan, Zhanxi; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bosman, Michel] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 9 Engn Dr 1, Singapore 117575, Singapore; [Bosman, Michel] ASTAR, Inst Mat Res & Engn, 2 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore 138634, Singapore; [Ling, Chongyi; Wang, Jinlan] Southeast Univ, Sch Phys, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Wu, Lin; Akimov, Yuriy A.; Laskowski, Robert] ASTAR, Inst High Perfo<    rmance Comp, 1 Fusionopolis Way,16-16 Connexis, Singapore 138632, Singapore; [Ercius, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Qi, Xiaoying; Goh, Min Hao] ASTAR, Singapore Inst Mfg Technol, 71 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 638075, Singapore; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA+ City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; National University of Singapore; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of Materials Research & Engineering (IMRE); Southeast University - China; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech); University of California System; University of California Berkeley¬∞ Zhang, H (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Chem, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zhang, H (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong Branch, Natl Precious Met Mat Engn Res Ctr NPMM, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.'  hmzheng@lbl.gov; hua.zhang@cityu.edu.hkf CHEN, BO/L-1011-2015; Zhang, Zhicheng/P-6560-2016; Ercius, Peter/AAN-2870-2020; Wu, Lin/GOE-3613-2022; Wu, Lin/AAZ-6876-2020; Bosman, Michel/AAW-3584-2020; Niu, Wenxin/E-7538-2010; Zhang, Hua/A-1302-2009; Chen, Ye/N-9543-2015; Zhang, Zhicheng/AAQ-2833-2020; Wu, Lin/GNW-6519-2022; Ling, Chongyi/AAU-2129-2020; GE, Yiyao/ADL-4331-2022; Fan, Zhanxi/J-6512-2018¬ß CHEN, BO/0000-0001-6743-9251; Zhang, Zhicheng/0000-0002-2487-4250; Ercius, Peter/0000-0002-6762-9976; Wu, Lin/0000-0002-3188-0640; Bosman, Michel/0000-0002-8717-7655; Niu, Wenxin/0000-0002-0835-3295; Zhang, Hua/0000-0001-9518-740X; Chen, Ye/0000-0003-0821-7469; Wu, Lin/0000-0002-3188-0640; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; GE, Yiyao/0000-0002-2546-005X; Fan, Zhanxi/0000-0003-3133-6503; Akimov, Yuriy/0000-0002-2679-2240¬† U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; DOE BES [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; ITC via Hong Kong Branch of National Precious Metals Material Engineering Research Center (NPMM); City University of Hong Kong [9380100, 9610480, 7200651, 9610478, 1886921];  [NRF2016-NRF-ANR002];  [MOE2019-T2-1-179]‚Äú U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE BES(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); ITC via Hong Kong Branch of National Precious Metals Material Engineering Research Center (NPMM); City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong); ; ‚Äû We would like to acknowledge the Facility for Analysis, Characterization, Testing, and Simulation, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, for their electron microscopy (and/or X-ray) facilities.

The electron beam serves as a light source to initiate the catalytic reaction and a water-in-salt aqueous solution is employed as the electrolyte. The observation reveals that bubbles are generated preferentially residing near the {110} facet of a rutile TiO2 nanorod under a low electron dose rate (9.3-18.6 e(-)/angstrom(2).s). These bubbles are ascribed to hydrogen gas generated from the pseudo-photocatalytic water splitting. As the electron beam current density increases to 93 e(-)/angstrom(2).s, bubbles are also found at the {001} and {111} facets as well as in the bulk liquid solution, demonstrating the dominant effects of water electrolysis by electron beam under higher dose rates. The facet-dependent pseudo-photocatalytic behavior of rutile TiO2 nanorods is further validated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Our work establishes a facile liquid cell TEM setup for the study of pseudo-photocatalytic water splitting and it may also be applied to investigation of other photo-activated phenomena occurring at the solidliquid interfaces.‚Äö [Yin, Zu-Wei; Li, Jun-Tao; Sun, Shi-Gang] Xiamen Univ, Coll Energy, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Yin, Zu-Wei; Betzler, Sophia B.; Zhang, Qiubo; Peng, Xinxing; Bustillo, Karen C.; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sheng, Tian; Peng, Xinxing; Sun, Shi-Gang] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surface, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Tian] Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China; [Shangguan, Junyi; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√í  Xiamen University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Xiamen University; Anhui Normal University; University of California System; University of California Berkeleyb  Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.2  Peng, Xinxing/U-4102-2019; Sheng, Tian/G-1120-2017‚Ä¶  Sheng, Tian/0000-0001-5711-3012; Peng, Xinxing/0000-0002-7077-8454; Yin, Zuwei/0000-0002-0728-1154; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170√ê U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under situ TEM program (KC22ZH) program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; China Scholarship Council [201606310151]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; NSFC [21621091]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China [2015J01063]v U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under situ TEM program (KC22ZH) program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundat<    ion of Fujian Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province)H This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the in situ TEM program (KC22ZH) program.

Compared to common 2D materials such as graphene or metal hydroxides, with their intrinsic layered atomic structures, the formation mechanisms of 2D metal oxides with a rocksalt structure are not well understood. Here, we report the formation process for 2D cobalt oxide and cobalt nickel oxide nanosheets, after analysis by in situ liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that three-dimensional (3D) nanoparticles are initially formed from the molecular precursor solution and then transform into 2D nanosheets. Ab initio calculations show that a small nanocrystal is dominated by positive edge energy, but when it grows to a certain size, the negative surface energy becomes dominant, driving the transformation of the 3D nanocrystal into a 2D structure. Uncovering these growth pathways, including the 3D-to-2D transition, provides opportunities for future material design and synthesis in solution.# [Yang, Juan; Zeng, Zhiyuan; Kang, Jun; Betzler, Sophia; Zhang, Xiaowei; Wang, Lin-Wang; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yang, Juan; Yu, Chang; Qiu, Jieshan] Dalian Univ Technol, Liaoning Key Lab Energy Mat & Chem Engn, Sch Chem Engn, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Yang, Juan] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Czarnik, Cory; Pan, Ming] Gatan Inc, Pleasanton, CA USA; [Ophuss, Colin; Bustillo, Karen] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA USA; [Qiu, Jieshan] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Chem Engn, State Key Lab Chem Resource Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAK United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Dalian University of Technology; Xi'an Jiaotong University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√∂ Wang, LW; Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Qiu, JS (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Liaoning Key Lab Energy Mat & Chem Engn, Sch Chem Engn, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian, Peoples R China.;Qiu, JS (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Chem Engn, State Key Lab Chem Resource Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.1  jqiu@dlut.edu.cn; lwwang@lbl.gov; hmzheng@lbl.gov¬Æ  wang, lili/HDL-7210-2022; wang, lin/GSE-3040-2022; Yang, Juan/P-4525-2014; Qiu, Jieshan/C-6276-2013; zeng, zhiyuan/G-7571-2015; wang, lin/HHM-2225-2022; Kang, Jun/F-7105-2011¬ß  zeng, zhiyuan/0000-0001-7483-1438; Kang, Jun/0000-0003-4788-0028; Qiu, jieshan/0000-0002-6892-6665; Ophus, Colin/0000-0003-2348-8558; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170‚Äì US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC22ZH]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Natural Science Foundation of China [51802251, U1508201]; China Scholarship Council [201506060073]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M631168]√æ US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)‚Äû This work was funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

Electronic moires formed in van der Waals heterostructures have proved to be an ideal platform. However, there is no holistic experimental picture for how superlattices modify electronic structure. By combining spatially resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with optical spectroscopy, we report the first direct evidence of how strongly correlated phases evolve from a weakly interacting regime in a transition metal dichalcogenide superlattice. By comparing short and long wave vector moires, we find that the electronic structure evolves into a highly localized regime with increasingly flat bands and renormalized effective mass. The flattening is accompanied by the opening of a large gap in the<     spectral function and splitting of the exciton peaks. These results advance our understanding of emerging phases in moire superlattices and point to the importance of interlayer physics. [Stansbury, Conrad H.; Utama, M.

Herein, the tuned fabrication of ultrathin and tortuous nickel/cobalt-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanosheets via a graphene oxide (GO) surface-confined strategy is reported, yielding nanosheets with a thickness of 1.7-1.8 nm that is duplicated from the graphene oxides in terms of both the lateral size and the shape. It has been found that the C/O functional groups on the GO surface have functioned to promote the oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+, and to transform the beta-phase NiCo-hydroxide (NiCo-OH) into the LDH-phase with tuned homogenous composition and geometry. The ultrathin NiCo-LDH nanosheets mimic the morphology and size of the graphene due to the surface-confined and/or surface-guided growth. The as-obtained NiCo-LDH-graphene (NiCo-LDH-G) nanosheets exhibit a superior electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, evidenced by a small overpotential of 0.337 V (@10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte), and a high charge storage capability of 1489 F g(-1) as electrodes for supercapacitors. This 2D surface-confined growth strategy may pave a way f<   or the fabrication of ultrathin 2D materials including but not limited to transition metal hydroxides for high-performance electrochemical applications.√ö [Yang, Juan; Hu, Chao; Wang, Man] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yu, Chang; Li, Shaofeng; Huang, Huawei; Han, Xiaotong; Zhao, Changtai; Guo, Wei; Qiu, Jieshan] Dalian Univ Technol, Liaoning Key Lab Energy Mat & Chem Engn, Sch Chem Engn, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Bustillo, Karen] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zeng, Zhiyuan; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Qiu, Jieshan] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Chem Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R ChinaK Xi'an Jiaotong University; Dalian University of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Beijing University of Chemical Technology√ò Qiu, JS (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Liaoning Key Lab Energy Mat & Chem Engn, Sch Chem Engn, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Qiu, JS (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Chem Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.!  hmzheng@lbl.gov; jqiu@dlut.edu.cn¬≥  Yang, Juan/P-4525-2014; Yu, Chang/A-9751-2016; Li, Shaofeng/AAS-2477-2020; Qiu, Jieshan/C-6276-2013; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Zhao, Changtai/D-5890-2016; zeng, zhiyuan/G-7571-2015 Yu, Chang/0000-0003-3359-1970; Li, Shaofeng/0000-0002-9500-2636; Zhao, Changtai/0000-0001-8630-9188; zeng, zhiyuan/0000-0001-7483-1438; Qiu, jieshan/0000-0002-6892-6665; Huang, Huawei/0000-0003-2270-5506; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Hu, Chao/0000-0003-4538-6018√∫ National Natural Science Foundation of China [21336001, 51802251]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M631168]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [xjj2018036]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Chinese Scholarship Council [201506060073]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]‚Äì National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√ü This work was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 21336001, 51802251), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2018M631168), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. xjj2018036).

It is a direct approach to address critical scientific questions on how materials form or transform in response to external stimuli, such as changes in chemical potential, applied electric bias, and interactions with other materials or their environment. Answers to these questions are essential for understanding and controlling nanoscale materials properties and advancing their applications. With the recent technical advances in TEM, such as the development of sample stages, detectors, and image processing toolkits, liquid phase TEM is transforming our ability to characterize materials and revolutionizing our understanding of many fundamental processes in materials science and other fields. In this article, we briefly review the current status, challenges, and opportunities in liquid phase TEM.

In this Review, we focus on the emergent exciton physics in moire superlattices and in TMD heterobilayers coupled to optical cavities, where exciton behaviour can be dramatically modified by the environment. In moire superlattices, a small twist angle or lattice mismatch between the layers introduces a periodic variation in the interlayer alignment that leads to exciton localization, modified optical selection rules and strong correlations. In cavity-heterostructure systems, light-matter interaction is enhanced and exciton states can couple to the cavity to form exciton-polaritons, whose properties depend on the specific TMD layers involved and their alignment. Here, we discuss recent theoretical and experimental progress towards realizing exotic exciton states in TMD heterobilayers and comment on future scientific and technological directions. 2D semiconductor heterostructures host tightly bound exciton states that interact strongly with light. This Review discusses two approaches for realizing emergent excitonic physics in these systems: the introduction of a moire superlattice and the formation of an optical cavity.‚Äô [Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Paik, Eunice Y.; Zhang, Long; Deng, Hui] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zeng, Yongxin; Zhu, Jihang; MacDonald, Allan H.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Phys, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√õ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory! Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Deng, H (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;MacDonald, AH (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Phys, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.A  macd@physics.utexas.edu; dengh@umich.edu; fengwang76@berkeley.edu‚Äπ  MacDonald, Allan/GPF-8212-2022; MACDONALD, Clint/AAR-6962-2021; MacDonald, Allan/M-9883-2019; Wang, feng/I-5727-2015; Deng, Hui/E-8950-2010√ç  MacDonald, Allan/0000-0003-3561-3379; MACDONALD, Clint/0000-0003-0995-0072; Wang, feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Regan, Emma/0000-0002-9100-6031; Deng, Hui/0000-0003-0629-3230; Zeng, Yongxin/0000-0003-1081-1707¬• US Army Research Office under MURI [W911NF-17-1-0312]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA2386-18-1-4086]; National Science Foundation [DMR 1838412]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCWF16]; Department of Defense through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) fellowship programme√ª US Army Research Office under MURI(MURI); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Department of Defense through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) fellowship programme√Å E.Y.P., Y.Z., L.Z., J.Z., A.H.M., H.D. and F.W. acknowledge support from the US Army Research Office under MURI award W911NF-17-1-0312.

Strong acid electrolytes are desirable for many implementations of these technologies, although the deployment of such device designs is often hampered by the lack of non-precious-metal oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, with Ir-based oxides comprising the only known catalysts that exhibit stable activity at low overpotential. During our exploration of the Mn-Sb-O system for precious-metal-free electrocatalysts, we discovered that Mn can be incorporated into the rutile oxide structure at much higher concentrations than previously known, and that these Mn-rich rutile alloys exhibit great catalytic activity with current densities exceeding 50 mA cm(-2) at 0.58 V overpotential and catalysis onset at 0.3 V overpotential. While this activity does not surpass that of IrO2, Pourbaix analysis reveals that the Mn-Sb rutile oxide alloys have the same or better thermodynamic stability under operational conditions. By combining combinatorial composition, structure, and activity mapping with synchrotron X-ray absorption measurements and first principles materials chemistry calculations, we provide a comprehensive understanding of these oxide alloys and identify the critical role of Sb in stabilizing the trivalent Mn octahedra that have been shown to be effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts.√å [Zhou, Lan; Shinde, Aniketa; Richter, Matthias H.; Stein, Helge S.; Haber, Joel A.; Gregoire, John M.] CALTECH, Joint Ctr Artificial Photosynth, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Montoya, Joseph H.; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Environm Energy Technol Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Singh, Arunima; Yano, Junko; Ye, Yifan; Cooper, Jason K.; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Joint Ctr Artificial Photosynth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Singh, Arunima; Ye, Yifan; Cooper, Jason K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Chem Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gul, Sheraz; Yano, Junko] Lawrence Ber<    keley Natl Lab, Mol Biophys & Integrated Bioimaging Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ye, Yifan; Crumlin, Ethan J.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Richter, Matthias H.] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA California Institute of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; California Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California Berkeley¬∫ Gregoire, JM (corresponding author), CALTECH, Joint Ctr Artificial Photosynth, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Environm Energy Technol Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Joint Ctr Artificial Photosynth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.'  kapersson@lbl.gov; gregoire@caltech.edu‚Ñ¢  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Cooper, Jason/AAK-8660-2021; Crumlin, Ethan/AAZ-3087-2020; Gregoire, John/F-8854-2018; Shinde, Aniketa/B-4681-2008√î  Richter, Matthias/0000-0003-0091-2045; Zhou, Lan/0000-0002-7052-266X; Singh, Arunima/0000-0002-7212-6310; Gregoire, John/0000-0002-2863-5265; Cooper, Jason/0000-0002-7953-4229; Shinde, Aniketa/0000-0003-2386-38486 Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0004993]; Materials Project Program through the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [KC23MP, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Science of the DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-AC02-76SF00515]; Office of Science, OBES, Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences (CSGB) of the DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Beckman Institute of the California Institute of Technologyd Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Materials Project Program through the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, OBES, Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences (CSGB) of the DOE; Beckman Institute of the California Institute of Technology√ß This study is based upon work performed by the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a DOE Energy Innovation Hub, supported through the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy (Award DE-SC0004993).

However, control over internal device charge distributions by tuning interactions between molecules has proved challenging. Here, we show that gate-tunable charge patterning can occur in one-dimensional molecular arrays on graphene field-effect transistors. One-dimensional molecular arrays are fabricated using an edge-templated self-assembly process that allows organic molecules (F(4)TCNQ) to be precisely positioned on graphene devices. The charge configurations of the molecular arrays can be reversibly switched between different collective charge states by tuning the graphene Fermi level via a back-gate electrode. Charge pinning at the ends of the molecular arrays allows the charge state of the entire array to be controlled by adding or removing an edge molecule and changing the total number of molecules in an array between odd and even integers. Charge patterns altered in this way propagate down the array in a cascade effect, allowing the array to function as a charge-based molecular shift register. An extended multi-site Anderson impurity model is used to quantitatively explain this behaviour. One-dimensional molecular arrays on graphene field-effect transistors can be reversibly switched between different periodic charge states by tuning the graphene Fermi level via a back-gate electrode and by manipulating individual molecules, allowing them to function as a nanoscale shift register.√Ñ [Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Su, Chenliang] Shenzhen Univ, Minist Educ, Int Collaborat Lab 2D Mat Optoelect Sci & Technol, Inst Microscale Optoelect, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Lischner, Johannes; Omrani, Arash A.; Liou, Franklin; Aikawa, Andrew S.; Wickenburg, Sebastian; Riss, Alexander; Natividad, Kyler C.; Chen, Jin; Choi, Won-Woo; Louie, Steven G.; Zettl, Alex; Lu, Jiong; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Liou, Franklin; Aikawa, Andrew S.; Wickenburg, Sebastian; Louie, Steven G.; Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lischner, Johannes] Imperial Coll London, Dept Mat, London, England; [Karrasch, Christoph] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Math Phys, Braunschweig, Germany; [Watanabe, Kenji; Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lu, Jiong] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem, Singapore, Singapore; [Lu, Jiong] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Adv 2D Mat, Singapore, Singapore; [Riss, Alexander] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept E20, Garching, Germany¬∫ Shenzhen University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Imperial College London; Braunschweig U<    niversity of Technology; National Institute for Materials Science; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Technical University of Munich, Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.X  Karrasch, Christoph/S-5716-2016; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/J-1682-2016; Riss, Alexander/C-1565-2014p  Karrasch, Christoph/0000-0002-5627-5041; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/0000-0003-2097-0170; Riss, Alexander/0000-0002-3212-7925¬ø US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC1203]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1926004, DMR-1807233]; MEXT Japan [JPMXP0112101001]; CREST, JST [JPMJCR15F3]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [P2ELP2-151852]; ARCHER UK National Supercomputing Service under EPSRC [EP/L000202, EP/R029431]; Singapore Ministry of Education [R-143-000-A06-112]; Shenzhen Peacock Plan [KQJSCX20170727100802505, KQTD2016053112042971]; EPSRC [EP/R029431/1] Funding Source: UKRI√™ US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MEXT Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); CREST, JST(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Postdoctoral Research Fellowship(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); ARCHER UK National Supercomputing Service under EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Shenzhen Peacock Plan; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))M This work was funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

This problem may be addressed by using named entity recognition (NER) to extract structured summary-level data from unstructured materials science text. We compare the performance of four NER models on three materials science datasets. The four models include a bidirectional long shortterm memory (BiLSTM) and three transformer models (BERT, SciBERT, and MatBERT) with increasing degrees of domain-specific materials science pre-training. MatBERT improves over the other two BERTBASE-based models by 1%similar to 12%, implying that domain-specific pre-training provides measurable advantages. Despite relative architectural simplicity, the BiLSTM model consistently outperforms BERT, perhaps due to its domain-specific pre-trained word embeddings. Furthermore, MatBERT and SciBERT models outperform the original BERT model to a greater extent in the small data limit. MatBERT's higher-quality predictions should accelerate the extraction of structured data from materials science literature.n [Walker, Nicholas; Lee, Sanghoon; Dagdelen, John; Dunn, Alexander; Jain, Anubhav] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Trewartha, Amalie; Huo, Haoyan; Cruse, Kevin; Ceder, Gerbrand] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huo, Haoyan; Lee, Sanghoon; Cruse, Kevin; Dagdelen, John; Dunn, Alexander; Persson, Kristin A.; Ceder, Gerbrand] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 210 Hearst Mem Min Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA∆í  Walker, N; Jain, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  walkermr@lbl.gov; ajain@lbl.govj  Dunn, Alexander/0000-0002-8567-1879; Huo, Haoyan/0000-0003-2227-9121; Walker, Nicholas/0000-0001-6939-953Xw Toyota Research Institute through the Accelerated Materials Design and Discovery program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]y Toyota Research Institute through the Accelerated Materials Design and Discovery program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User FacilityK This work was funded by Toyota Research Institute through the Accelerated Materials Design and Discovery program.

A comprehensive description of gas transport in liquid and following reactions at the solid-liquid-gas interface, which is substantial in regard to achieving enhanced triple-phase reactions, remains unavailable. Here, we report a real-time observation of the accelerated etching of gold nanorods with oxygen nanobubbles in aqueous hydrobromic acid using liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that when an oxygen nanobubble is close to a nanorod below the critical distance (similar to 1nm), the local etching rate is significantly enhanced by over one order of magnitude. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that the strong attractive van der Waals interaction between the gold nanorod and oxygen molecules facilitates the transport of oxygen through the thin liquid layer to the gold surface and thus plays a crucial role in increasing the etching rate. This result sheds light on the rational design of solid-liquid-gas reactions for enhanced activities.√∫ [Wang, Wen; Xu, Tao; Sun, Litao] Southeast Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Micro Nano Fabricat Device, Minist Educ, SEU FEI Nanopico Ctr,Key Lab MEMS, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wen; Shangguan, Junyi; Zhang, Qiubo; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Jige] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Adv Res Inst, Zhangjiang Lab, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiat Facil, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jige; Ma, Huishu] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Appl Phys, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Shangguan, Junyi; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dong, Hui] Xiangtan Univ, Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Complex Tracks Proc Technol & Equipm, Key Lab Welding Robot & Applicat Technol Hunan Pr, Xiangtan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Junwei] Shanghai Dianji Univ, Sch Arts & Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Bai, Tingting; Guo, Zhirui] Nanjing Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Key Lab Aging & Dis, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Fang, Haiping] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Phys, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Fang, Haiping] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Natl Engn Res Ctr Ind Wastewater Detoxicat & Reso, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wen] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Mech & Safety Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China Southeast University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, CAS; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Xiangtan University; Shanghai Dianji University; Nanjing Medical University; East China University of Science & Technology; East China University of Science & Technology; Zhengzhou Universityf Sun, LT (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Micro Nano Fabricat Device, Minist Educ, SEU FEI Nanopico Ctr,Key Lab MEMS, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Fang, HP (corresponding author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Phys, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Fang, HP (corresponding author), East China Univ Sci & Technol, Natl Engn Res Ctr Ind Wastewater Detoxicat & Reso, Shanghai, Peoples R China.8  fanghaiping@sinap.ac.cn; hmzheng@lbl.gov; slt@seu.edu.cnF  Chen, Jige/ABG-5974-2020; Xu, Tao/N-2539-2013; yang, jun/GQH-0635-2022^  Chen, Jige/0000-0001-6954-6413; Xu, Tao/0000-0001-5436-0077; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170 US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC22ZH]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51420105003, 11327901, 61601116, 61974021]; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [11525415]; Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [14ZR1448100, 19ZR1463200]; Shanghai Supercomputer Center of China; China Scholarship Council [201806090114]; Big Data Science Center of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility≈° US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai); Shanghai Supercomputer Center of China; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Big Data Science Center of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility√∞ This work is especially for the 120th anniversary of Southeast University.

However, it has been very challenging to directly image solid-liquid interfaces with high resolution, thus their structure and properties are often unknown. Here, we report a quasi-liquid phase between metal (In, Sn) nanoparticle surfaces and an aqueous solution observed using liquid cell transmission electron microscopy. Our real-time high-resolution imaging reveals a thin layer of liquid-like materials at the interfaces with the frequent appearance of small In nanoclusters. Such a quasi-liquid phase serves as an intermediate for the mass transport from the metal nanoparticle to the liquid. Density functional theory-molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the positive charges of In ions greatly contribute to the stabilization of the quasi-liquid phase on the metal surface. Solid-liquid interfaces are ubiquitous in natural and technological processes, but their imaging at the atomic scale has been challenging. The authors, using liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy, identify a quasi-liquid phase and the mass transport between the surface of In and Sn nanocrystals and an aqueous solution.n [Peng, Xinxing; Zhu, Fu-Chun; Jiang, You-Hong; Sun, Juan-Juan; Xiao, Liang-Ping; Zhou, Shiyuan; Lin, Long-Hui; Cheng,<     Jun; Li, Jian-Feng; Liao, Hong-Gang; Sun, Shi-Gang] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Peng, Xinxing; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Peng, Xinxing; Bustillo, Karen C.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Natl Ctr Elect Microscopy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√∑  Xiamen University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley{ Liao, HG (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA."  hgliao@xmu.edu.cn; hmzheng@lbl.gov  ; Li, Jian-Feng/J-5843-2015i  Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Xiao, Liangping/0000-0002-9552-1823; Li, Jian-Feng/0000-0003-1598-6856√â U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0100202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21673198, 21673194, 21621091, 21401049, 51272071]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√• U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the KC22ZH program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬Å The work at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the KC22ZH program.

Single-phase multiferroics are challenged by the opposite d-orbital occupations imposed by the two ferroics, and heterogeneous nanocomposite multiferroics demand ingredients' structural compatibility with the resultant multiferroicity exclusively at inter-materials boundaries. Here we propose the two-dimensional heterostructure multiferroics by stacking up atomic layers of ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6 and ferroelectric In2Se3, thereby leading to all-atomic multiferroicity. Through first-principles density functional theory calculations, we find as In2Se3 reverses its polarization, the magnetism of Cr2Ge2Te6 is switched, and correspondingly In2Se3 becomes a switchable magnetic semiconductor due to proximity effect. This unprecedented multiferroic duality (i.e., switchable ferromagnet and switchable magnetic semiconductor) enables both layers for logic applications. Van der Waals heterostructure multiferroics open the door for exploring the low-dimensional magnetoelectric physics and spintronic applications based on artificial superlattices.; [Gong, Cheng; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSEC, 3112 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kim, Eun Mi; Lee, Geunsik] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiang] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ç  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory> Zhang, X (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, NSEC, 3112 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Lee, G (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.;Zhang, X (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.%  gslee@unist.ac.kr; xiang@berkeley.edu≈†  Lee, Geunsik/R-1723-2019; Wang, Yuan/F-7211-2011; Zhang, Xiang/F-6905-2011; Wang, Yuan/HHC-1520-2022; wangwangwang, yuanyaun/HHN-6432-2022b  Lee, Geunsik/0000-0002-2477-9990; Wang, Yuan/0000-0001-7892-2812; Zhang, Xiang/0000-0002-3272-894X√ó U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under the van der Waals Heterostructures program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCWF16]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [1753380]; King Abdulah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) [OSR-2016-CRG5-2996]; National Research Foundation of Korea (Basic Science Research Program) [2018R1D1A1B07045983]; KISTI [KSC-2018-CRE-0048]√ª U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under the van der Waals Heterostructures program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); King Abdulah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR); National Research Foundation of Korea (Basic Science Research Program); KISTI(Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI))¬ª C.G., Y.W., and X.Z. acknowledge the support from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

Many heuristic methods for controlling the morphological characteristics of gold nanoparticles are well known. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling their size and shape remain poorly understood, partly due to the immense range of possible combinations of synthesis parameters. Data-driven methods can offer insight to help guide understanding of these underlying mechanisms, so long as sufficient synthesis data are available. To facilitate data mining in this direction, we have constructed and made publicly available a dataset of codified gold nanoparticle synthesis protocols and outcomes extracted directly from the nanoparticle materials science literature using natural language processing and text-mining techniques. This dataset contains 5,154 data records, each representing a single gold nanoparticle synthesis article, filtered from a database of 4,973,165 publications. Each record contains codified synthesis protocols and extracted morphological information from a total of 7,608 experimental and 12,519 characterization paragraphs.¬π [Cruse, Kevin; Lee, Sanghoon; Wang, Zheren; Huo, Haoyan; He, Tanjin; Kononova, Olga; Ceder, Gerbrand] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cruse, Kevin; Trewartha, Amalie; Wang, Zheren; Huo, Haoyan; He, Tanjin; Kononova, Olga; Ceder, Gerbrand] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lee, Sanghoon; Jain, Anubhav] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAf  Ceder, Gerbrand/0000-0001-9275-3605; Wang, Zheren/0000-0002-2742-9451; Huo, Haoyan/0000-0003-2227-9121√©  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231, BES-ERCAP0020531] U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬• This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (D2S2 program KCD2S2).

Purposely enhancing the inherent heterogeneity to promote distributed flow offers new possibilities in improving the ductility of monolithic MGs. Here, we report the effect of the spatial heterogeneity of elasticity, resulting from the inherently inhomogeneous amorphous structures, on the deformation behavior of MGs, specifically focusing on the ductility using multiscale modeling methods. A highly heterogeneous, Gaussian-type shear modulus distribution at the nanoscale is revealed by atomistic simulations in Cu(64)Zr(36)MGs, in which the soft population of the distribution exhibits a marked propensity to undergo the inelastic shear transformation. By employing a mesoscale shear transformation zone dynamics model, we find that the organization of such nanometer-scale shear transformation events into shear-band patterns is dependent on the spatial heterogeneity of the local shear moduli. A critical spatial correlation length of elastic heterogeneity is identified for the simulated MGs to achieve the best tensile ductility, which is associated with a transition of shear-band formation mechanisms, from stress-dictated nucleation and growth to structure-dictated strain percolation, as well as a saturation of elastically soft sites participating in the plastic flow. This discovery is important for the fundamental understanding of the role of spatial heterogeneity in influencing the deformation behavior of MGs. We believe that this can facilitate the design and development of new ductile monolithic MGs by a process of tuning the inherent heterogeneity to achieve enhanced ductility in these high-strength metallic alloys.∆í [Wang, Neng; Yan, Feng; Li, Lin] Univ Alabama, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Ding, Jun; Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yan, Feng; Li, Lin] Univ Alabama, Ctr Mat Informat Technol, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Asta, Mark; Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of California System; University of California Berkeley Li, L (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.;Ding, J (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Li, L (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Ctr Mat Informat Technol, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.  ding@lbl.gov; lin.li@eng.ua.eduN  Ding, Jun/K-1989-2012; wang, neng/ABH-8038-2020; Ritchie, Robert O/A-8066-2008√Å  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) [DE-SC0016164, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√ü  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))d This work was supported by the U.

Interlayer electron-electron interactions, <    for example, have enabled fascinating physics that is difficult to achieve in a single material, such as the Hofstadter's butterfly in graphene/boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures(5-10). In addition to electron-electron interactions, interlayer electron-phonon interactions allow for further control of the physical properties of van der Waals heterostructures. Here we report an interlayer electron-phonon interaction in WSe2/hBN heterostructures, where optically silent hBN phonons emerge in Raman spectra with strong intensities through resonant coupling to WSe2 electronic transitions. Excitation spectroscopy reveals the double-resonance nature of such enhancement, and identifies the two resonant states to be the A exciton transition of monolayer WSe2 and a new hybrid state present only in WSe2/hBN heterostructures. The observation of an interlayer electron-phonon interaction could open up new ways to engineer electrons and phonons for device applications.√ò [Jin, Chenhao; Kim, Jonghwan; Shi, Zhiwen; Kam, Matthew; Zettl, Alex; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Suh, Joonki; Wu, Junqiao] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Bin; Fan, Xi; Tongay, Sefaattin] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Watanabe, Kenji; Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Zettl, Alex; Wu, Junqiao; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ê University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; National Institute for Materials Science; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryt Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.! Suh, Joonki/H-6755-2017; Chen, Bin/L-6417-2016; Chen, Bin/H-7618-2019; Shi, Zhiwen/L-8792-2019; Wu, Junqiao/G-7840-2011; Tongay, Sefaattin/E-6388-2011; Tongay, Sefaattin/ACQ-5306-2022; JIN, CHENHAO/GYV-5734-2022; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015; Shi, Zhiwen/C-4945-2013; Watanabe, Kenji/H-2825-2011, Suh, Joonki/0000-0002-0221-8447; Chen, Bin/0000-0002-2106-7664; Chen, Bin/0000-0002-2106-7664; Shi, Zhiwen/0000-0002-3928-2960; Wu, Junqiao/0000-0002-1498-0148; Tongay, Sefaattin/0000-0001-8294-984X; wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Shi, Zhiwen/0000-0002-3928-2960; Watanabe, Kenji/0000-0003-3701-8119  Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCWF16]; US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; David and Lucile Packard fellowship; NSF CAREER award [DMR 1552220]; MEXT, Japan; JSPSf Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); David and Lucile Packard fellowship(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); NSF CAREER award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); MEXT, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)√ü We thank S.

Q.X  Independence of the spin current from the Neel vector orientation in antiferromagnet CoO  FERROMAGNETIC-RESONANCE. Spin pumping from ferromagnetic Fe into antiferromagnetic CoO across a Ag spacer layer was studied using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in Py/CoO/Ag/Fe/Ag(001). The thin Py film on top of CoO permits an alignment of the CoO Neel vector through field cooling in two otherwise equivalent [110] and [1 (1) over bar0] crystalline axes which are parallel and perpendicular to the Fe magnetization direction, respectively. Fe FMR linewidth is measured as a function of Ag thickness in 10-20-GHz frequency range and in 180-330 K temperature range. We find that there exists an anisotropy in the Fe FMR damping for parallel and perpendicular alignment of the Fe and CoO spins. However, such anisotropic damping exists only at thin Ag thickness where there exists a magnetic interlayer coupling between Fe and CoO, and vanishes at thick Ag thickness where the interlayer coupling becomes negligible but permitting spin-current transmission into CoO. Our result indicates the absence of anisotropic spin current for parallel and perpendicular alignment of the Fe and CoO spin axes.‚Ñ¢ [Yang, M.; Li, Q.; Wang, T. Y.; Qiu, Z.

Our study provides novel mechanistic insights into the SEI growth process on Si, and we discuss several important implications regarding ion and electron transport through the SEI layer. [Cao, Chuntian; Abate, Iwnetim Iwnetu; Shyam, Badri; Steinruck, Hans-Georg; Toney, Michael F.] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, SSRL Mat Sci Div, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Cao, Chuntian; Abate, Iwnetim Iwnetu] Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Abate, Iwnetim Iwnetu; Jia, Chunjing; Moritz, Brian; Devereaux, Thomas P.] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford Inst Mat & Energy Sci, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Abate, Iwnetim Iwnetu; Jia, Chunjing; Moritz, Brian; Devereaux, Thomas P.] Stanford Univ, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Sivonxay, Eric; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA6 Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; Stanford University; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Berkeleyu  Steinruck, HG; Toney, MF (corresponding author), SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, SSRL Mat Sci Div, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.0  hgs@slac.stanford.edu; mftoney@slac.stanford.edu√∏  Abate, Iwnetim/ABF-5013-2021; Toney, Michael/ABD-5429-2021; Steinr√ºck, Hans-Georg/A-6382-2015; Cao, Chuntian/ABI-6654-2020; Sefcovic, Joel/X-6416-2019; Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Abate, Iwnetim/AAV-6991-2021; Moritz, Brian J/D-7505-2015‚Ä¢  Toney, Michael/0000-0002-7513-1166; Steinr√ºck, Hans-Georg/0000-0001-6373-0877; Cao, Chuntian/0000-0003-4753-7334; Moritz, Brian J/0000-0002-3747-8484! Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-76SF00515]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering at the SLAC; National Science Foundation [ECCS-1542152]; Battery Materials Research (BMR) program, under the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Vehicle Technologies of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC-02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]; National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]∆í Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering at the SLAC(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Battery Materials Research (BMR) program, under the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Vehicle Technologies of the U.S. Department of Energy; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬è It is a pleasure to thank Oleg Borodin (U.S. Army Research Laboratory) for fruitful discussions that inspired part of the conclusions drawn in this report.

So far, the optical excitations in 2D semiconductors are dominated by Wannier-Mott excitons, but molecular systems can host Frenkel excitons (FE) with unique properties. Here, we report a strong optical response in a class of monolayer molecular J-aggregates. The exciton exhibits giant oscillator strength and absorption (over 30% for monolayer) at resonance, as well as photoluminescence quantum yield in the range of 60-100%. We observe evidence of superradiance (including increased oscillator strength, bathochromic shift, reduced linewidth and lifetime) at room-temperature and more progressively towards low temperature. These unique properties only exist in monolayer owing to the large unscreened dipole interactions and suppression of charge-transfer processes. Finally, we demonstrate light-emitting devices with the monolayer J-aggregate. The intrinsic device speed could be beyond 30 GHz, which is promising for next-generation ultrafast on-chip optical communications.√ü [Zhao, Huijuan; Lv, Wei; Tao, Liu; Ma, Yue; Zhang, Junqing; Chen, Xiaoqing;

These requirements fundamentally limit our ability to synthesize macroscopic materials where the likelihood of impurity inclusion escalates and, more importantly, to access molecular-to-nanoscopic-to-microscopic-to-macroscopic hierarchies, since the types and compositions of building blocks vary at each stage. Inspired by biological blends and high-entropy alloys, we hypothesize that diversifying the blend's composition can overcome these limitations. Increasing the number of components increases mixing entropy, leading to the dispersion of different components and, as a result, enhances interphase miscibility, weakens the dependence on specific pair interactions, and enables long-range cooperativity. This hypothesis is validated in complex blends containing small molecules, block copolymer-based supramolecules, and nanoparticles/colloidal particles. Hierarchically structured composites can be obtained with formulation flexibility in the filler selection and blend composition. It is worth noting that, by adding small molecules, we can solve the size constraint that plagues traditional block copolymer/nanoparticle blends. Detailed characterization and simulation further confirm that each component is distributed to locally mediate unfavorable interactions, cooperatively mitigate composition fluctuations, and retain structural fidelity. Furthermore, the blends have sufficient mobility to access tunable microstructures without compromising the order of the nanostructure. Besides establishing a kinetically viable pathway to release current constraints in the composite design and to navigate uncertainties during structure formation over multiple length scales, the present study demonstrates that entropydriven behaviors can be realized in systems beyond high-entropy alloys despite inherent differences between metal alloys and organic/inorganic hybrids.2 [Ma, Le; Vargo, Emma; Huang, Jingyu; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ma, Le; Vargo, Emma; Chen, Tiffany; Liu, Yi; Xu, Ting] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huang, Hejin; Alexander-Katz, Alfredo] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Anderson, Christopher L.; Chen, Tiffany; Xu, Ting] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Anderson, Christopher L.; Liu, Yi] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kuzmenko, Ivan; Ilavsky, Jan] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Wang, Cheng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ercius, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA> University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,  Liu, yi/A-3384-2008; Wang, Cheng/A-9815-2014z  Liu, yi/0000-0002-3954-6102; Vargo, Emma/0000-0003-2624-8381; Ma, Le/0000-0002-3583-3390; Huang, Hejin/0000-0002-9250-8797√• U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DEAC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH1135]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]6 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))G This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DEAC02-05-CH11231 (Organic-Inorganic Nanocomposites KC3104).

O.; Egami, T.S  Universal nature of the saddle states of structural excitations in metallic glasses  MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICSg  Metallic glasses; Potential energy landscape; beta relaxation; Saddle state; Local structural evolution¬´ A widely used schematic picture of the potential energy landscape (PEL) for liquid and glass gives an impression that the pathway of moving from a valley to another through a saddle point is predetermined. However, in reality the pathway is much more stochastic and unpredictable because thermal history is wiped out at the saddle point and the pathway down is randomly chosen. Here we explain this puzzling behavior through the study of local structural evolutions in the beta relaxation process by atomistic simulations of structural excitations for metallic glasses. We find that the saddle states in the PEL show universal melt-like features in short-range order and atomic dynamics, independent of thermal history and composition. We propose that the short-lived local melting at the saddle point is responsible for wiping out the prior thermal history. This explains why the activation and relaxation stages of the b process are decoupled. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the nature of the saddle states in elucidating the system dynamics, and pose a question on the current view on the system evolution in the PEL.

Q.7  Magnetic anisotropy in permalloy antidot square lattice+  JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS!  MAGNETORESISTANCE; NANOSTRUCTURES¬• Magnetic anisotropy of Permalloy (Py) antidot square lattice was investigated by torquemetry method using Rotation Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (ROTMOKE). We find that there exists a field-dependent 4-fold magnetic anisotropy with the easy magnetization axis along the [11] axis of the antidot square lattice. In addition, there also exists an artifact of a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in ROTMOKE result. We show that both results are due to the period wiggling of the magnetization in space which was confirmed by magnetic imaging using magnetic transmission soft x-ray microscopy (MTXM). Micromagnetic simulation from MuMax3 supports the wiggling structure of the magnetization, as well as reproduces ROTMOKE result. A simplified model was developed based on the periodic wiggling of the magnetization and successfully explored the physical origin of the field-dependent 4-fold anisotropy and the artifact of the uniaxial anisotropy.‚Ä† [Wang, T.

The resulting (240)-oriented PbHfO3 (Pba2) films exhibited antiferroelectric switching with a saturation polarization approximate to 53 mu C cm(-2) at 1.6 MV cm(-1), weak-field dielectric constant approximate to 186 at 298 K, and an antiferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition at approximate to 518 K. (002)-oriented SrHfO3 films exhibited neither ferroelectric behavior nor evidence of a polar P4mm phase . Instead, the SrHfO3 films exhibited a weak-field dielectric constant approximate to 25 at 298 K and no signs of a structural transition to a polar phase as a function of temperature (77-623 K) and electric field (-3 to 3 MV cm(-1)). While the lack of ferroelectric order in SrHfO3 removes the potential for MPB, structural and property evolution of the Pb1-xSrxHfO3 (0 <= x < 1) system is explored. Strontium alloying increased the electric-breakdown strength (E-B) and decreased hysteresis loss, thus enhancing the capacitive energy storage density (U-r) and efficiency (eta). The composition, Pb0.5Sr0.5HfO3 produced the best combination of E-B = 5.12 +/- 0.5 MV cm(-1), U-r = 77 +/- 5 J cm(-3), and eta = 97 +/- 2%, well out-performing PbHfO3 and other antiferroelectric oxides.¬® [Acharya, Megha; Ramesh, Maya; Jiang, Yizhe; Fernandez, Abel; Dasgupta, Arvind; Ling, Handong; Persson, Kristin; Martin, Lane W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Acharya, Megha; Banyas, Ella; Persson, Kristin; Neaton, Jeffrey B.; Martin, Lane W.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hanrahan, Brendan] US Army, Res Lab, Adelphi, MD 20783 USA; [Persson, Kristin; Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy Nanosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√≤ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Defense; US Army Research, Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM); US Army Research Laboratory (ARL); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√à  Martin, LW (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Martin, LW (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  lwmartine@berkeley.edu"  ACHARYA, MEGHA/0000-0001-9618-1771n U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC23MP]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [1752814]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1708615]; Army Research Office [W911NF-21-20162, W911NF-21-1-0118]; Army Research Office under the ETHOS MURI [W911NF-21-20162]; Army Research Laboratory/Army Research Office via the Collaborative for Hierarchical Agile and Resonant Materials (CHARM) [W911NF-19-2-0119]v U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Army Research Office; Army Research Office under the ETHOS MURI; Army Research Laboratory/Army Research Office via the Collaborative for Hierarchical Agile and Resonant Materials (CHARM)√† This work was primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (Materials Project program KC23MP) for the discovery of novel functional materials.

However, it is challenging to determine whether classical dendrite growth theories are applicable at the nanoscale due to the lack of detailed information on the nanodendrite growth dynamics. Here, we study iron oxide nanodendrite formation using liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We observe seaweed-like iron oxide nanodendrites growing predominantly in two dimensions on the membrane of a liquid cell. By tracking the trajectories of their morphology development with high spatial and temporal resolution, it is possible to explore the relationship between the tip curvature and growth rate, tip splitting mechanisms, and the effects of precursor diffusion and depletion on the morphology evolution. We show that the growth of iron oxide nanodendrites is remarkably consistent with the existing theoretical predictions on dendritic morphology evolution during growth, despite occurring at the nanoscale.v [Hauwiller, Matthew R.; Zhang, Xiaowei; Liang, Wen-I; Chiu, Chung-Hua; Zheng, Wenjing; Asta, Mark; Alivisatos, A.

Specifically, cracks are grown in a gradient structured (GS) nickel with grain-size gradient ranging from the coarse macro-scale to nano-scale (CG -> NG) and vice versa (NG -> CG), with the measured crack-resistance R-curves compared to the corresponding behavior in uniform nano-grained (NG) and coarse-grained (CG) materials. It is found that the gradient structures display a much-improved combination of high strength and toughness compared to uniform grain-sized materials. However, based on J-integral measurements in the gradient materials, the crack-initiation toughness is far higher for cracks grown in the direction of the coarse-to-nano grained gradient than vice versa, a result which we ascribe primarily to excessive crack-tip blunting in the coarse-grained microstructure. Both gradient structures, however, display marked rising R-curve behavior with exceptional crack-growth toughnesses exceeding 200 MPa.m(1/2).¬ª [Cao, Ruqing; Pan, Jie; Lin, Yan; Li, Yi] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenyang Natl Lab Mat Sci, Inst Met Res, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Cao, Ruqing] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qin; Sweet, Andrew; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sweet, Andrew; Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA. Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Metal Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryL Li, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shenyang Natl Lab Mat Sci, Inst M<    et Res, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.!  liyi@imr.ac.cn; roritchie@lbl.govP  Li, Yi/K-8838-2012; Pan, Jie/L-3928-2017; Yu, Qin/J-9116-2019; Li, Y/J-9029-2016p  Li, Yi/0000-0001-7123-681X; Pan, Jie/0000-0001-5465-0736; Yu, Qin/0000-0002-5099-0327; Li, Y/0000-0001-7123-681Xq U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0702003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51471165]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]¬µ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√è This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (for Q.Y. and R.O.R) under contract no.

The resulting Moire potential leads to a strong modification of the band structure, which can give rise to exotic quantum phenomena ranging from correlated insulators and superconductors to Moire excitons and Wigner crystals. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic tuning of Moire potential in a WSe2/WS2 heterostructure at cryogenic temperature. We utilize the optical fiber tip of a cryogenic scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) to locally deform the heterostructure and measure its near-field optical response simultaneously. The deformation of the heterostructure increases the Moire potential, which leads to a red shift of the Moire exciton resonances. We observe the interlayer exciton resonance shifts up to 20 meV, while the intralayer exciton resonances shift up to 17 meV.√ã [Zhao, Wenyu; Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing; Hsieh, Satcher; Wang, Zhiyuan; Wang, Jialu; Wang, Zilin; Yao, Norman Y.; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing; Hsieh, Satcher; Yao, Norman Y.; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jin, Chenhao] Kavli Inst Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Yumigeta, Kentaro; Blei, Mark; Tongay, Sefaattin] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Watanabe, Kenji] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Res Ctr Funct Mat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Int Ctr Mat Nanoarchitecton, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√∫ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; National Institute for Materials Science; National Institute for Materials Science; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryt Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.S  Tongay, Sefaattin/ACQ-5306-2022; JIN, CHENHAO/GYV-5734-2022; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015f  Tongay, Sefaattin/0000-0001-8294-984X; wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Zhao, Wenyu/0000-0001-5740-5613 Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KCWF16]; Office of Naval research (MURI) [N00014-16-1-2921]; DOE [SC0020653]; NSF [CMMI 1933214, DMR 1552220, DMR 1955889]; Elemental Strategy Initiative by the MEXT, Japan [JPMXP0112101001]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP20H00354]; CREST, JST [JPMJCR15F3]; Department of Defense through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program;  [NNCI-ECCS-1542160]

We used on-chip terahertz spectroscopy to measure the frequency-dependent optical conductivity of clean, micrometer-scale graphene at electron temperatures between 77 and 300 kelvin. At charge neutrality, we observed the quantum-critical scattering rate characteristic of the Dirac fluid. At higher doping, we detected two distinct current-carrying modes with zero and nonzero total momenta, a manifestation of relativistic hydrodynamics. Our work reveals the quantum criticality and unusual dynamic excitations near charge neutrality in graphene. [Gallagher, Patrick; Yang, Chan-Shan; Lyu, Tairu; Tian, Fanglin; Kou, Rai; Zhang, Hai; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gallagher, Patrick; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gallagher, Patrick; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yang, Chan-Shan] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Inst Electroopt Sci & Technol, Taipei 11677, Taiwan; [Tian, Fanglin] Nankai Univ, Sch Phys, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hai] Nanchang Inst Technol, Sch Informat Engn, Nanchang 330099, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Watanabe, Kenji; Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬ß University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; National Taiwan Normal University; Nankai University; Nanchang Institute Technology; National Institute for Materials Science; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory‚Äö  Watanabe, Kenji/ABB-2135-2021; Kou, Rai/CAF-2300-2022; Yang, Chan-Shan/GLU-8669-2022; Kou, Rai/L-3812-2018; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015¬¶  Watanabe, Kenji/0000-0003-3701-8119; Kou, Rai/0000-0002-1418-9137; wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Lyu, Tairu/0000-0001-9235-9296; Yang, Chan-Shan/0000-0002-5682-8531≈æ Office of Naval Research [N00014-15-1-2651]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCWF16]; Heising-Simons Junior Fellowship program of the Kavli ENSI at Berkeley; Ministry of Science and Technology [105-2917-I-564-026]; JSPS Overseas Research Fellowship program; Elemental Strategy Initiative; CREST, JST [JPMJCR15F3]4 Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Heising-Simons Junior Fellowship program of the Kavli ENSI at Berkeley; Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); JSPS Overseas Research Fellowship program; Elemental Strategy Initiative; CREST, JST(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)) Terahertz measurements were primarily supported by the Office of Naval Research under award N00014-15-1-2651.

Unfortunately, there are currently no known materials that are efficient, selective, or active enough to facilitate the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at an industrial scale. In this work, we employ density functional theory to explore potential tellurium-containing photocathodes for the CO2RR by observing trends in adsorption properties arising from over 350 *H, 200 *CO, and 110 *CHO surface-adsorbate structures spanning 39 surfaces of 11 materials. Our results reveal a scaling relationship between *CHO and *H chemisorption energies and charge transfer values, while the scaling relation (typically found in transition metals) between *CO and *CHO adsorption energies is absent. We hypothesize the scaling relation between *H and *CHO to be related to the lone electron located on the bonding carbon atom, while the lack of scaling relation in *CO we attribute to the ability of the lone pair on the C atom to form multiple bonding modes. We compute two predominant orbital-level interactions in the *CO-surface bonds (either using sigma or pi orbitals) in addition to bonding modes involving both sigma and pi interactions using the Crystal Orbital Hamiltonian Population analysis. We demonstrate that bonds involving the C s orbital are more chemisorptive than the C p orbitals of CO. In general, chemisorption trends demonstrate decreased *H competition with respect to *CO adsorption and enhanced *CHO stability. Finally, we uncover simple element-specific design rules with Te, Se, and Ga sites showing increased competition and Zn, Yb, Rb, Br, and Cl sites showing decreased competition for hydrogen adsorption. We anticipate that these trends will help further screen these materials for potential CO2RR performance.j [Siron, Martin; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Siron, Martin; Andriuc, Oxana] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Liquid Sunlight Alliance, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Andriuc, Oxana] Univ Calif, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAn  Andriuc, Oxana/0000-0002-4011-3339; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Siron, Martin/0000-0002-4562-7814f Liquid Sunlight Alliance; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Fuels from Sunlight Hub [DE-SC0021266]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0004993]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DGE 1752814]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE 1752814]! Liquid Sunlight Alliance; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Fuels from Sunlight Hub(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Departme<    nt of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))b This work was funded by the Liquid Sunlight Alliance, which is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Fuels from Sunlight Hub under Award Number DE-SC0021266 and by the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a DOE Energy Innovation Hub, supported through the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Award Number DE-SC0004993.

Historically, such efforts have performed calculations at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level of theory due to its efficient compromise between accuracy and computational reliability. However, high-throughput calculations at the higher metaGGA level of theory are becoming feasible. The strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) metaGGA functional offers superior accuracy to GGA across much of chemical space, making it appealing as a general-purpose metaGGA functional, but it suffers from numerical instabilities that impede its use in high-throughput workflows. The recently developed r(2)SCAN metaGGA functional promises accuracy similar to SCAN in addition to more robust numerical performance. However, its performance compared to SCAN has yet to be evaluated over a large group of solid materials. In this paper, we compared r(2)SCAN and SCAN predictions for key properties of approximately 6000 solid materials using a newly developed high-throughput computational workflow. We find that r(2)SCAN predicts formation energies more accurately than SCAN and PBEsol for both strongly and weakly bound materials and that r(2)SCAN predicts systematically larger lattice constants than SCAN. We also find that r(2)SCAN requires modestly fewer computational resources than SCAN and offers significantly more reliable convergence. Thus, our large-scale benchmark confirms that r(2)SCAN has delivered on its promises of numerical efficiency and accuracy, making it a preferred choice for high-throughput metaGGA calculations.√ä [Kingsbury, Ryan; Gupta, Ayush S.; Bartel, Christopher J.; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kingsbury, Ryan] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gupta, Ayush S.; Munro, Jason M.; Dwaraknath, Shyam; Horton, Matthew] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA5 University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryn  Bartel, Christopher/0000-0002-5198-5036; Gupta, Ayush/0000-0002-1875-8405; Kingsbury, Ryan/0000-0002-7168-3967¬º  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [1640899] U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea)√• We gratefully acknowledge J.

Different from the Mauri's 180 degrees spiral wall, we find that the NiO spiral wall always switches its chirality at similar to 90. rotation of the Fe magnetization, and unwinds the spiral wall back to a single domain with a further rotation of the Fe magnetization from 90 degrees to 180 degrees. The effect of this chirality switching on themagnetic anisotropy was studied using rotationalmagneto-optic Kerr effect (ROTMOKE) on√Ω√ø√ø√ø

We find that the original Mauri's model has to be corrected by an energy folding due to the chirality switching, which consequently converts the exchange bias from the Mauri's 180 degrees spiral wall into a uniaxial anisotropy and a negative fourfold anisotropy.D [Li, Q.; Yang, M.; Gao, N.; Wang, T.

Q.O  Coherent ac spin current transmission across an antiferromagnetic CoO insulatorP The recent discovery of spin current transmission through antiferromagnetic insulating materials opens up vast opportunities for fundamental physics and spintronics applications. The question currently surrounding this topic is: whether and how could THz antiferromagnetic magnons mediate a GHz spin current? This mismatch of frequencies becomes particularly critical for the case of coherent ac spin current, raising the fundamental question of whether a GHz ac spin current can ever keep its coherence inside an antiferromagnetic insulator and so drive the spin precession of another ferromagnet layer coherently? Utilizing element- and time-resolved x-ray pump-probe measurements on Py/Ag/CoO/Ag/ Fe75Co25/MgO(001) heterostructures, here we demonstrate that a coherent GHz ac spin current pumped by the Py ferromagnetic resonance can transmit coherently across an antiferromagnetic CoO insulating layer to drive a coherent spin precession of the Fe75Co25 layer. Further measurement results favor thermal magnons rather than evanescent spin waves as the mediator of the coherent ac spin current in CoO.7 [Li, Q.; Yang, M.; Wang, T. Y.; Gao, N.; Qiu, Z.

A non-ferromagnetic ground state is correctly predicted in 95% of the benchmark materials, with the experimentally determined ground state ordering found exactly in over 60% of cases. Knowledge of the ground state magnetic order at scale opens up the possibility of high-throughput screening studies based on magnetic properties, thereby accelerating discovery and understanding of new functional materials.- [Horton, Matthew Kristofer; Montoya, Joseph Harold; Persson, Kristin Aslaug] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Miao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Persson, Kristin Aslaug] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat, Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ã  United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Physics, CAS; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√å  Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat, Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.<  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Liu, Miao/N-9937-2013  Liu, Miao/0000-0002-1843-9519¬ù Computational Materials Sciences Program - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0014607]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]¬π Computational Materials Sciences Program - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility√¨ M.K.H. acknowledges the primary support of BASF through the California Research Alliance (CARA) and the many useful conversations with our colleagues at BASF.

An assisted-microwave preparation of Li2CuPO4, which is otherwise difficult to prepare in nearly pure form, has been developed. The electrochemical performance of all three compounds has been investigated. The cyclability of these materials is found to be poor due to structural changes, irreversible reduction to metallic copper at potentials as high as 2.5 V, and the possibility of dissolution into the electrolyte.

At the nanometer-scale dimensions relevant for modern applications, these phenomena become increasingly more pronounced. Until now, helicity-independent all-optical switching (HI-AOS) has been largely limited to amorphous Gd-Fe-Co alloys, for which scaling was challenging due to their relatively low anisotropies. In this work, we demonstrate HI-AOS in amorphous GdCo and scale it to nanometer dimensions while still maintaining uniform out-of-plane magnetization. Single shot HI-AOS is demonstrated in these patterned samples down to a minimum optically detectable magnetic dot size of 200nm. The ultrafast switching behavior was also confirmed using time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements and found to settle to its opposite magnetization state at faster rates for smaller dot diameters, passing a threshold of 75% magnetization reversal within approximately 2 ps for a 200nm dot compared to approximately 40 ps for a 15m pattern. The size dependence of the ultrafast switching is explained in terms of the electron-phonon and spin-lattice interactions.k [El-Ghazaly, Amal; Lambert, Charles-Henri; Pattabi, Akshay; Salahuddin, Sayeef; Bokor, Jeffrey] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tran, Brandon; Hellman, Frances] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ceballos, Alejandro; Hellman, Frances] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ä  University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeleyn  El-Ghazaly, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  aelghazaly@berkeley.edu  Bokor, Jeffrey/A-2683-2011m  Bokor, Jeffrey/0000-0002-4541-0156; Tran, Brandon/0000-0001-9147-3628; Salahuddin, Sayeef/0000-0002-0315-2208√º  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Science Foundation [0939514]; University of California President's Postdoctoral Fellowship ProgramK U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of California President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program(University of California System)¬∂ The authors thank Daisy O'Mahoney, P.

These multiorder quantum materials are expected to exhibit new topological phases that can be tuned with magnetic fields, but the search for such materials is stymied by difficulties in predicting magnetic structure and stability. Here, we compute more than 27,000 unique magnetic orderings for more than 3000 transition metal oxides in the Materials Project database to determine their magnetic ground states and estimate their effective exchange parameters and critical temperatures. We perform a high-throughput band topology analysis of centrosymmetric magnetic materials, calculate topological invariants, and identify 18 new candidate ferromagnetic topological semimetals, axion insulators, and antiferromagnetic topological insulators. To accelerate future efforts, machine learning classifiers are trained to predict both magnetic ground states and magnetic topological order without requiring first-principles calculations. [Frey, Nathan C.; Shenoy, Vivek B.] Univ Penn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Frey, Nathan C.; Horton, Matthew K.; Munro, Jason M.; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Horton, Matthew K.; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; [Griffin, Sinead M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Griffin, Sinead M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAQ University of Pennsylvania; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory^  Shenoy, VB (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.  vshenoy@seas.upenn.edu_  Shenoy, Vivek/ABD-5075-2021; Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Frey, Nathan C./M-7197-2019q  Frey, Nathan C./0000-0001-5291-6131; Munro, Jason M./0000-0002-3047-0367; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509‚Ä¢ U.S. Department of Defense through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship program; NSF [EFMA-542879, CMMI-1727717]; Army Research Office [W911NF-16-1-0447]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]¬¥ U.S. Department o<    f Defense through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship program; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Army Research Office; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√ª N.C.F. was supported by the U.S. Department of Defense through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship program.

Here, we report the etching of palladium nanocrystals imaged using liquid cell transmission electron microscopy. The adsorption of surface ligands (i.e., iron acetylacetonate and its derivatives) and their role as inhibitor molecules on the etching process were investigated. Our observations revealed that the etching was dominated by the interplay between palladium facets and ligands and that the etching exhibited different pathways at different concentrations of ligands. At a low concentration of iron acetylacetonate (0.1 mM), rapid etching primarily at {100} facets led to a concave structure. At a high concentration (1.0 mM), the etch rate was decreased owing to a protective film of iron acetylacetonate on the {100} facets and a round nanoparticle was achieved. Ab initio calculations showed that the differences in adsorption energy of inhibitor molecules on palladium facets were responsible for the etching behavior.√Æ [Zheng, Qi; Shangguan, Junyi; Zhang, Qiubo; Wang, Lin-Wang; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Qi; Jiang, Jinyang] Southeast Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinle] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Xinle] Clark Atlanta Univ, Dept Chem, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA; [Bustillo, Karen C.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA) United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Southeast University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Clark Atlanta University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory√â  Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Jiang, JY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.E  Wang, Lin-Wang/0000-0001-7061-2692; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170q U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Science and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51925903]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0705401]¬µ U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Science and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China0 This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Science and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the KC22ZH program.

However, the synthesis of a multielemental system has so far relied on the CE phenomenon of a binary system, which does not necessarily extend to the higher-order systems. Here, direct experimental evidence supported by theoretical calculations reveals a growth model of binary Cu-S to ternary Cu-Sn-S to quaternary Cu-Zn-Sn-S, which shows that cations preferentially diffuse along a specific lattice plane with the preservation of sulfuric anionic framework. In addition, we also discover that, unlike the commonly accepted structure (P6(3)mc), the metastable crystal structure of Cu-Zn-Sn-S phase possesses fixed Sn occupancy sites. By revealing the preferential nature of cations diffusion and growth mechanism, our work provides insight into controlling the stoichiometry and phase purity of novel multielemental materials.! [Tan, Joel M.

GRAPHENE; POLARIZATION; INSULATOR√† Moire superlattices provide a powerful way to engineer the properties of electrons and excitons in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures(1-8). The moire effect can be especially strong for interlayer excitons, where electrons and holes reside in different layers and can be addressed separately. In particular, it was recently proposed that the moire superlattice potential not only localizes interlayer exciton states at different superlattice positions, but also hosts an emerging moire quasi-angular momentum (QAM) that periodically switches the optical selection rules for interlayer excitons at different moire sites(9,10). Here, we report the observation of multiple interlayer exciton states coexisting in a WSe2/WS2 moire superlattice and unambiguously determine their spin, valley and moire QAM through novel resonant optical pump-probe spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. We demonstrate that interlayer excitons localized at different moire sites can exhibit opposite optical selection rules due to the spatially varying moire QAM.

Here, we demonstrate the bottom-up assembly and spectroscopic characterization of a one-dimensional Kondo spin chain formed by a chevron-type GNR (cGNR) physisorbed on Au(111). Substitutional nitrogen core doping introduces a pair of low-lying occupied states per monomer within the semiconducting gap of cGNRs. Charging resulting from e the interaction with the gold substrate quenches one electronic state for each monomer, leaving behind a ID chain of radical cations commensurate with the unit cell of the ribbon. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) reveal the signature of a Kondo resonance emerging from the interaction of S = 1/2 spin centers in each monomer core with itinerant electrons in the Au substrate. STM tip lift-off experiments locally reduce the effective screening of the unpaired radical cation being lifted, revealing a robust exchange coupling between neighboring spin centers. First-principles DFT-LSDA calculations support the presence of magnetic moments in the core of this GNR when it is placed on Au.X [Wen, Ethan Chi Ho; McCurdy, Ryan D.; Fischer, Felix R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jacobse, Peter H.; Jiang, Jingwei; Wang, Ziyi; Louie, Steven G.; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jiang, Jingwei; Louie, Steven G.; Crommie, Michael F.; Fischer, Felix R.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Crommie, Michael F.; Fischer, Felix R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Crommie, Michael F.; Fischer, Felix R.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA Fischer, FR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Louie, SG; Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Louie, SG; Crommie, MF; Fischer, FR (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF; Fischer, FR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF; Fischer, FR (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.A  sglouie@berkeley.edu; crommie@berkeley.edu; ffischer@berkeley.edu≈í  Jiang, Jingwei/0000-0002-0949-4401; McCurdy, Ryan/0000-0001-7319-4836; Wen, Ethan Chi Ho/0000-0002-8656-5285; Wang, Ziyi/0000-0003-1049-5038√ê US Department of Energy (DOE) , Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) , Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Office of Naval Research [DMR-1839098, N00014-19-1-2503, N00014-19-1-2596]; National Science Foundation [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; US Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Croucher Foundation; Dutch Research Council [N00014-20-1-2824]; NIH [019.182EN.18, S10-OD024998];  [S10-RR027172] US Department of Energy (DOE) , Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) , Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Croucher Foundation; Dutch Research Council; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); √ª This work was primarily funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) , Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) , Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (Nanomachine program KC1203) (molecular design, surface characterization, ab initio calculations) .

Because the electrons in the atomically thin 2D layers are exposed to layer-to-layer coupling, the properties of van der Waals heterostructures are defined not only by the constituent monolayers, but also by the interactions between the layers. Many fascinating electrical, optical and magnetic properties have recently been reported in different types of van der Waals heterostructures. In this Review, we focus on unique excited-state dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterostructures. TMDC monolayers are the most widely studied 2D semiconductors, featuring prominent exciton states and accessibility to the valley degree of freedom. Many TMDC heterostructures are characterized by a staggered band alignment. This band alignment has profound effects on the evolution of the excited states in heterostructures, including ultrafast charge transfer between the layers, the formation of interlayer excitons, and the existence of long-lived spin and valley polarization in resident carriers. Here we review recent experime<    ntal and theoretical efforts to elucidate electron dynamics in TMDC heterostructures, extending from timescales of femtoseconds to microseconds, and comment on the relevance of these effects for potential applications in optoelectronic, valleytronic and spintronic devices.e [Jin, Chenhao; Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ma, Eric Yue; Karni, Ouri; Heinz, Tony F.] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ma, Eric Yue; Heinz, Tony F.] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Regan, Emma C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√¶ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Stanford University; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory" Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Heinz, TF (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Heinz, TF (corresponding author), SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.0  fengwang76@berkeley.edu; tony.heinz@stanford.edu2  JIN, CHENHAO/GYV-5734-2022; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015@  wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Ma, Eric Yue/0000-0002-0539-15017 US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-76SF00515]; AMOS programme, Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences Division, Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-76-SF00515]; Betty and Gordon Moore Foundation's EPiQS Initiative [GBMF4545]; Rothschild Fellowship of Yad Hanadiv Fund, Israel; Viterbi Fellowship of the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion, Israel; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCWF16]; National Science Foundation EFRI programme [EFMA-1542741]; Department of Defense through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship programmeU US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); AMOS programme, Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences Division, Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Betty and Gordon Moore Foundation's EPiQS Initiative; Rothschild Fellowship of Yad Hanadiv Fund, Israel; Viterbi Fellowship of the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion, Israel; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation EFRI programme; Department of Defense through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship programme√µ E.Y.M. acknowledges support from the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under contract DE-AC02-76SF00515.

This phenomenon is reported in a heterostructure of 2D materials. Moire superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as a powerful tool for engineering quantum phenomena. Here we report the observation of a correlated interlayer exciton insulator in a double-layer heterostructure composed of a WSe2 monolayer and a WS2/WSe2 moire bilayer that are separated by ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride. The moire WS2/WSe2 bilayer features a Mott insulator state when the density of holes is one per moire lattice site. When electrons are added to the Mott insulator in the WS2/WSe2 moire bilayer and an equal number of holes are injected into the WSe2 monolayer, a new interlayer exciton insulator emerges with the holes in the WSe2 monolayer and the electrons in the doped Mott insulator bound together through interlayer Coulomb interactions. The interlayer exciton insulator is stable up to a critical hole density in the WSe2 monolayer, beyond which the interlayer exciton dissociates. Our study highlights the opportunities for realizing quantum phases in double-layer moire systems due to the interplay between the moire flat band and strong interlayer electron interactions.√ë [Zhang, Zuocheng; Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing; Zhao, Wenyu; Wang, Shaoxin; Crommie, Michael; Zettl, Alex; Zaletel, Michael P.; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing; Crommie, Michael; Zettl, Alex; Zaletel, Michael P.; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sayyad, Mohammed; Yumigeta, Kentaro; Tongay, Sefaattin] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ USA; [Watanabe, Kenji] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Res Ctr Funct Mat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Int Ctr Mat Nanoarchitecton, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Crommie, Michael; Zettl, Alex; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Crommie, Michael; Zettl, Alex; Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA<  Tongay, Sefaattin/ACQ-5306-2022; Watanabe, Kenji/H-2825-2011k  Tongay, Sefaattin/0000-0001-8294-984X; Watanabe, Kenji/0000-0003-3701-8119; Regan, Emma/0000-0002-9100-6031* U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Science<    s, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCWF16]; U.S. Army Research Office under MURI [W911NF-17-1-0312]; Department of Defense through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program; NSF [DMR 1552220, DMR 1955889, CMMI 1933214, mid-scale 1935994, 1904716]; Elemental Strategy Initiative [PMXP0112101001]; MEXT, Japan [PMXP0112101001]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP20H00354, JPMJCR15F3]; CREST, JST [JPMJCR15F3];  [DOE-SC0020653]

Of these alloys, one of the earliest, the 'Cantor alloy' CrMnFeCoNi, displays excellent damage-tolerance with tensile strengths of similar to 1 GPa and fracture toughness values in excess of 200 MPa root m; moreover, these mechanical properties tend to further improve at cryogenic temperatures. However, few studies have explored its corresponding fatigue properties. Here we expand on our previous study to examine the mechanics and mechanisms of fatigue-crack propagation in the CrMnFeCoNi alloy (similar to 7 mu m grain size), with emphasis on long-life, near-threshold fatigue behavior, specifically as a function of load ratio at temperatures between ambient and liquid-nitrogen temperatures (293 K-77 K). We find that Delta K-th fatigue thresholds are decreased with increasing positive load ratios, R between 0.1 and 0.7, but are increased at decreasing temperature. These effects can be attributed to the role of roughness-induced crack closure, which was estimated using compliance measurements. Evidence of deformation twinning at the crack tip during fatigue-crack advance was not apparent at ambient temperatures but seen at higher stress intensities (Delta K similar to 20 MPa root m) at 77 K by post mortem microstructural analysis for tests at R = 0.1 and particularly at 0.7. Overall, the fatigue behavior of this alloy was found to be superior, or at least comparable, to conventional cryogenic and TWIP steels such as 304 L or 316 L steels and Fe-Mn steels; these results coupled with the remarkable strength and fracture toughness of the Cantor alloy at low temperatures indicate significant promise for the utility of this material for applications at cryogenic environments.

However, as the crystal structure becomes more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to accurately correlate response characteristics to detailed atomic structure. We investigate, via annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation, the layered III-VI alloy GaSe0.5Te0.5 as a function of layer number. The local atomic structure and stacking sequence for different layers is explicitly determined. We complement the measurements with first-principles calculations of the total energy and electronic band structure of GaSe0.5Te0.5 for different crystal structures and layer number. The electronic band gap as well as the pi and pi + sigma plasmons are found to be sensitive to layer number.‚Ä° [Azizi, Amin; Antonius, Gabriel; Regan, Emma; Eskandari, Rahmatollah; Kahn, Salman; Wang, Feng; Louie, Steven G.; Zettl, Alex] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Azizi, Amin; Wang, Feng; Zettl, Alex] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kayli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Antonius, Gabriel] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Inst Rech Hydrogene, Dept Chim Biochim & Phys, Trois Rivieres, PQ G8Z 4M3, Canada; [Regan, Emma; Kahn, Salman; Wang, Feng; Louie, Steven G.; Zettl, Alex] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Regan, Emma] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAV University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley# Zettl, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zettl, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kayli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zettl, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.2  wang, Feng/I-5727-2015; Kahn, Salman/AAM-8596-2020@  wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Kahn, Salman/0000-0002-0012-3305r U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the van der Waals Heterostructure Program [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KCWF16]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC2207]; National Science Foundation [1542741, DMR-1807233, DMR-1508412, 787 ACI-1053575]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science AMP; Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program¬ê U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division within the van der Waals Heterostructure Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science AMP; Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) ProgramE This work was primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (DE-AC02-05-CH11231), within the van der Waals Heterostructure Program (KCWF16) which provided for the TEM characterization, imaging processing and modeling, and theoretical band structure calculations.

However, they cannot maintain their shape when the magnetic field is removed. Here, with a magneto-responsive and reconfigurable interfacial self-assembly (MRRIS) process, we show that FFs can be structured by a magnetic field and maintain their shape, like solids, after removing the magnetic field. The competing self-assembly of magnetic and nonmagnetic nano-particles at the liquid interface endow FFs with both reconfigur-ability and structural stability. By manipulating the external magnetic field, we show that it is possible to write  and erase  the shape of the FFs remotely and repeatedly. To gain an in-depth understanding of the effect of MRRIS on the structure of FFs, we systematically study the shape variation of these liquids under both the static and dynamic magnetic fields. Our study provides a simple yet novel way of manipulating FFs and opens opportunities for the fabrication of all-liquid devices.√û [Zhao, Sai; Zhang, Jun-Yan; Fu, Yuchen] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Shipei; Shum, Ho Cheung] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mech Engn, Hong Kong SAR, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xubo] Tech Inst Phys & Chem, Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Bioinspired Mat & Interfacial Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhaoyu] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Adv Study, Hong Kong Branch Chinese Natl Engn Res Ctr Tissue, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Ye, Ruquan] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Chem, State Key Lab Marine Pollut, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Tang, Ben Zhong] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Inst Aggregate Sci & Technol, Sch Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Calif 94720, Massachusetts 01003, Sendai, 9808577, Japan; [Chai, Yu] City Univ Hong Kong, City Univ Hong Kong Shenzhen Res Inst, Dept Phys, Shenzhen 518057, 518057, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China City University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Technical Institute of Physics & Chemistry, CAS; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; City University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen; City University of Hong Kong Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Calif 94720, Massachusetts 01003, Sendai, 9808577, Japan.;Chai, Y (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, City Univ Hong Kong Shenzhen Res Inst, Dept Phys, Shenzhen 518057, 518057, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China./  russell@mail.pse.umass.edu; yuchai@cityu.edu.hkC  Ye, Ruquan/AFD-6327-2022; Tang, Ben Zhong/B-3556-2009; /A-5337-2011√ö  Ye, Ruquan/0000-0002-2543-9090; Chai, Yu/0000-0001-6085-4321; ZHAO, Sai/0000-0001-9362-6835; Tang, Ben Zhong/0000-0002-0293-964X; FU, Yuchen/0000-0002-0070-9621; /0000-0002-6365-8825; Zhang, Jun-Yan/0000-0001-5392-2701	 Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [21304421]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [22003053]; Hong Kong Institute for Advanced Study [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]K Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hong Kong Institute for Advanced Study; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))' We acknowledge financial support from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (Project No. 21304421) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 22003053) .

Here, we report a closed-cage, onion nanostructure of covalent organic framework (COF) obtained through a low-temperature solvothermal synthesis. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the atomic arrangement in this COF onion, in which rich nitrogen was uniformly embedded in the periodic porous graphitic framework. The COF onion structure displayed graphitic features at a 0.33 nm interlayer spacing with Van der Waals interactions predominated between the layers. The onion layers exhibited significant heterogeneity in layer stacking by adopting a combination of different stacking modes. Defects were also found, such as five- or seven-member rings deviating from the perfect hexagonal lattice. These geometrical defects resulted in curving the 2D layers, which may have promoted the formation of onion nanostructures through a layer-by-layer attachment. We constructed a corresponding model that predicts COF onion properties. This novel onion exhibited a bandgap value of 2.56 eV, resembling other carbon-based nanomaterials, suggesting potential applications in sensors, photocatalysts, and nanoelectronics.n [Zheng, Qi; Zhang, Qiubo; Lee, Daewon; Reimer, Jeffrey A.; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Qi; Jiang, Jinyang] Southeast Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinle; Yang, Chongqing; Bustillo, Karen C.; Liu, Yi] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lee, Daewon; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mao, Haiyan; Reimer, Jeffrey A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Xinle] Clark Atlanta Univ, Dept Chem, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA` United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Southeast University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Clark Atlanta University√ë U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy<     Sciences (BES), Materials Science and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51925903]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0705401]; Kwanjeong Study Abroad Scholarship from the KEF (Kwan-jeong Educational Foundation) (KEF-2019); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231] U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Science and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Kwanjeong Study Abroad Scholarship from the KEF (Kwan-jeong Educational Foundation) (KEF-2019); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬¨ This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Science and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the KC22ZH program.

There has been a critical need for tunable ferromagnetic vdW materials beyond room temperature. Here, we report a real-space imaging study of itinerant ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 and the enhancement of its Curie temperature well above ambient temperature. We find that the magnetic long-range order in Fe3GeTe2 is characterized by an unconventional out-of-plane stripe-domain phase. In Fe3GeTe2 microstructures patterned by a focused ion beam, the out-of-plane stripe domain phase undergoes a surprising transition at 230 K to an in-plane vortex phase that persists beyond room temperature. The discovery of tunable ferromagnetism in Fe3GeTe2 materials opens up vast opportunities for utilizing vdW magnets in room-temperature spintronics devices. [Li, Qian; Yang, Mengmeng; Wang, Sheng; Gao, Nan; Wang, Feng; Qiu, Ziqiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gong, Cheng; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr NSEC, 3112 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chopdekar, Rajesh V.; N'Diaye, Alpha T.; Schol, Andreas; Shafer, Padraic; Arenholz, Elke] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Turner, John; Schmid, Andreas K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, NCEM, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Gong; Liu, Kai] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Phys, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Liu, Kai] Georgetown Univ, Dept Phys, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Admasu, Alemayehu S.; Cheong, Sang-Wook] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Ctr Emergent Mat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Admasu, Alemayehu S.; Cheong, Sang-Wook] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Hwang, Chanyong] Korea Res Inst Stand & Sci, Yuseong 305340, Daejeon, South Korea; [Li, Jia] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Int Ctr Quantum Mat, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Davis; Georgetown University; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Korea Research Institute of Standards & Science (KRISS); Peking University√™  wang, Feng/I-5727-2015; Zhang, Xiang/F-6905-2011; Chopdekar, Rajesh V/D-2067-2009; Qiu, Z.

More sophisticated heterostructures composed of TMD/hBN/TMD enable new ways to control interlayer exciton properties and achieve novel exciton phenomena, such as exciton insulators and condensates, where longer lifetimes are desired. In this work, we experimentally study the charge transfer dynamics in a heterostructure composed of a 1 nm thick hBN spacer between MoSe2 and WSe2 monolayers. We observe the hole transfer from MoSe2 to WSe2 through the hBN barrier with a time constant of 500 ps, which is over 3 orders of magnitude slower than that between TMD layers without a spacer. Furthermore, we observe strong competition between the interlayer charge transfer and intralayer exciton-exciton annihilation processes at high excitation densities. Our work opens possibilities to understand charge transfer pathways in TMD/hBN/TMD heterostructures for the efficient generation and control of interlayer excitons.

One application of interest to energy and optoelectronics is the prediction of new high performing p-type transparent conductors (TCs). However, screening methods for such materials have never been validated over the breadth of computed materials properties. In this study, we compile an experimental data set of 74 bulk crystal structures corresponding to known state-of-the-art n-type and p-type TCs and compute a series of corresponding computational descriptor properties. Our goals are to (1) compare computational descriptors to experimentally demonstrated properties of real materials in the data set, (2) determine the ability of ground state, density functional theory (DFT)-based computational screening methodologies to identify these experimentally realized TCs, and (3) use this understanding to estimate reasonable screening cutoffs for four commonly used descriptors. First, stability calculations demonstrate that most materials in the data set have an energy above the convex hull (E-hull) of <100 meV/atom, and we also propose a Pourbaix analysis technique to estimate moisture stability. Second, we find a lenient cutoff for the DFT PBE band gap of 0.5 eV is sufficient to include a majority of the wide gap candidates and exclude narrow gap compounds. Next, the effective mass, m*, is found to correlate weakly to conductivity in the p-type materials as compared with n-type materials, which may motivate an increase in the m* cutoff as well. Lastly, we perform an uncertainty analysis and literature comparison for the branch point energy (BPE), a qualitative descriptor for dopability. We find the BPEs of most n-type materials to lie near the conduction band and those of most p-type materials to lie at midgap; this is a significant distinction, suggesting BPE to be a more definitive descriptor for n-type TC materials. By assessing the validity of this simple screening methodology via comparing experimental data to computational descriptors, we aim to motivate and strengthen future materials discovery efforts in the field of transparent conductors and beyond.¬¶ [Woods-Robinson, Rachel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94702 USA; [Broberg, Danny; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94702 USA; [Woods-Robinson, Rachel; Faghaninia, Alireza; Jain, Anubhav; Dwaraknath, Shyam S.; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Woods-Robinson, Rachel] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA- University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University o<    f California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA¬Ω  Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94702 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  kpersson@lbl.govI  Woods-Robinson, Rachel/K-4205-2019; Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020¬ù  Woods-Robinson, Rachel/0000-0001-5009-9510; Dwaraknath, Shyam/0000-0003-0289-2607; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Jain, Anubhav/0000-0001-5893-9967$ Center for Next Generation Materials, Design (CNGMD), an Energy Frontier Research Center - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) [DGE1106400, DGE1752814]; U.C.

In dual-phase high-entropy alloys, the combination of local chemical environments and loading-induced crystal structure changes suggests a relationship between deformation mechanisms and chemical atomic distribution, which we examine in here in a Cantor-like Cr20Mn6Fe34Co34Ni6 alloy, comprising both face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal closed packed (hcp) phases. We observe that partial dislocation activities result in stable three-dimensional stacking-fault networks. Additionally, the fraction of the stronger hcp phase progressively increases during plastic deformation by forming at the stacking-fault network boundaries in the fcc phase, serving as the major source of strain hardening. In this context, variations in local chemical composition promote a high density of Lomer-Cottrell locks, which facilitate the construction of the stacking-fault networks to provide nucleation sites for the hcp phase transformation.‚Äû [Chen, Sijing; Zhang, Ze; Yu, Qian] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ctr Electron Microscopy, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sijing; Zhang, Ze; Yu, Qian] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Oh, Hyun Seok; Kim, Sang Jun; Park, Eun Soo] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Adv Mat, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Gludovatz, Bernd] UNSW Sydney, Sch Mech & Mfg Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Seoul National University (SNU); University of New South Wales Sydney; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley√Ö Yu, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ctr Electron Microscopy, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Yu, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.%  roritchie@lbl.gov; yu_qian@zju.edu.cn6  Park, Eun Soo/GYD-6387-2022; Park, Eun Soo/A-4443-2008!

In many applications, nanocapsules are designed to release their cargo as they buckle and collapse, but the details of this transient buckling process have not been directly observed. Here, we use in situ liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy to record the electron-irradiation-induced buckling in spherical 60-187 nm polymer capsules with similar to 3.5 nm walls. We observe in real time the release of aqueous cargo from these nanocapsules and their buckling into morphologies with single or multiple indentations. The in situ buckling of nanoscale capsules is compared to ex situ measurements of collapsed and micrometer-sized capsules and to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The shape and dynamics of the collapsing nanocapsules are consistent with MC simulations, which reveal that the excessive wrinkling of nanocapsules with ultrathin walls results from their large Foppl-von Karman numbers around 10(5). Our experiments suggest design rules for nanocapsules with the desired buckling response based on parameters such as capsule radius, wall thickness, and collapse rate.. [Alam, Sardar B.; Soligno, Giuseppe; Bustillo, Karen C.; Ercius, Peter; Whitelam, Stephen; Chan, Emory M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Alam, Sardar B.; Yang, Jiwoong; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Soligno, Giuseppe] Univ Utrecht, Debye Inst Nanomat Sci, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Yang, Jiwoong] Daegu Gyeongbuk Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Energy Sci & Engn, Daegu 72988, South Korea; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA3 United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Utrecht University; Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology (DGIST); University of California System; University of California Berkeleya  Chan, EM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  EMChan@lbl.govi  Chan, Emory/0000-0002-5655-0146; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Soligno, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2360-2082 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DEAC02-05-CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; European Union [691185]I U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); European Union(European Commission)Q This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DEAC02-05-CH11231 within the in situ TEM program (KC22ZH).

Nanoparticles nucleated and grew tracing the perimeter of droplets sitting on the SiNx solid substrate, and finally formed necklace-like rings. By tracking single nanoparticle trajectories during the ring formation and an estimation of the forces between droplets and nanoparticles using a simplified model, we found the junction of liquid nanodroplets with a solid substrate is the attractive site for CoO nanoparticles. Coalescing droplets were capable of pushing nanoparticles to the perimeter of the new droplet and nanoparticles on top of the droplets rolled off toward the perimeter. We propose that the curved surface morphology of the droplets created a force gradient that contributed to the assembly of nanoparticles at the droplet perimeter. Revealing the dynamics of nanoparticle movements and the interactions of nanoparticles with the liquid nanodroplet provides insights on developing novel self-assembly strategies for building precisely defined nanostructures on solid substrates.√´ [Zhou, Yilong; Xu, Tao; Sun, Litao] Southeast Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab MEMS, SEU FEI Nanopico Ctr, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yilong; Zhang, Xiaowei; Xu, Tao; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Powers, Alexander S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Xiaowei] Nanjing Univ, Natl Lab Solid State Microstruct, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaowei] Nanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Microstruct, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bustillo, Karen] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAn Southeast University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Nanjing University; Nanjing University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California BerkeleyQ Sun, LT (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab MEMS, SEU FEI Nanopico Ctr, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.D  Sun, Litao/D-4289-2013; Xu, Tao/N-2539-2013; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019^  Sun, Litao/0000-0002-2750-5004; Xu, Tao/0000-0001-5436-0077; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170i U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; China Scholarship Council [201406090067, 201406190080]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51420105003, 11525415, 113279028]; DOE Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231]¬• U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); DOE Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√é We used the facility at NCEM/Molecular Foundry in Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of S<    cience, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, under contract no.

Q.; Hellman, F.X  Itinerant ferromagnetism and intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in amorphous iron-germaniumw The amorphous iron-germanium system (a-FexGe1-x) lacks long-range structural order and hence lacks a meaningful Brillouin zone. The magnetization of a-FexGe1-x is well explained by the Stoner model for Fe concentrations x above the onset of magnetic order around x = 0.4, indicating that the local order of the amorphous structure preserves the spin-split density of states of the Fe-3d states sufficiently to polarize the electronic structure despite k being a bad quantum number. Measurements reveal an enhanced anomalous Hall resistivity rho(AH)(xy) relative to crystalline FeGe; this rho(AH)(xy) is compared to density-functional theory calculations of the anomalous Hall conductivity to resolve its underlying mechanisms. The intrinsic mechanism, typically understood as the Berry curvature integrated over occupied k states but shown here to be equivalent to the density of curvature integrated over occupied energies in aperiodic materials, dominates the anomalous Hall conductivity of a-FexGe1-x (0.38 <= x <= 0.61). The density of curvature is the sum of spin-orbit correlations of local orbital states and can hence be calculated with no reference to k space. This result and the accompanying Stoner-like model for the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity establish a unified understanding of the underlying physics of the anomalous Hall effect in both crystalline and disordered systems.' [Bouma, D.

Automated workflows and materials databases are being rapidly developed, contributing to high-throughput data of bulk materials that are growing in quantity and complexity, allowing for correlation between structural-chemical features and functional properties. In contrast, computational data driven approaches are still relatively rare for nanomaterials discovery due to the rapid scaling of computational cost for finite systems. However, the distinct behaviors at the nanoscale as compared to the parent bulk materials and the vast tunability space with respect to dimensionality and morphology motivate the development of data sets for nanometric materials. In this review, we discuss the recent progress in data-driven research in two aspects: functional materials design and guided synthesis, including commonly used metrics and approaches for designing materials properties and predicting synthesis routes. More importantly, we discuss the distinct behaviors of materials as a result of nanosizing and the implications for data-driven research. Finally, we share our perspectives on future directions for extending the current data-driven research into the nano realm.Q [Yang, Ruo Xi; McCandler, Caitlin A.; Siron, Martin; Woods-Robinson, Rachel; Horton, Matthew K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [McCandler, Caitlin A.; Siron, Martin; Horton, Matthew K.; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Andriuc, Oxana] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Andriuc, Oxana] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Liquid Sunlight Alliance & Chem Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Energy Sci Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAy United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University <    of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory= Yang, RX (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Persson, KA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Energy Sci Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.$  ruoxiyang@lbl.gov; kapersson@lbl.gov√§  Yang, Ruo Xi/0000-0001-8225-5856; McCandler, Caitlin/0000-0003-2616-310X; Persson, Kristin A./0000-0003-2495-5509; Andriuc, Oxana/0000-0002-4011-3339; Woods-Robinson, Rachel/0000-0001-5009-9510; Siron, Martin/0000-0002-4562-7814 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Fuels from Sunlight Hub [DE-SC0021266]6 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Fuels from Sunlight Hub(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√í This work was intellectually led by the Materials Project, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231: Materials Project Program KC23MP.

One class of materials that defy this trend are CrCoNi-based medium- and high-entropy alloys, as they display enhanced strength, ductility, and toughness with decreasing temperature. Here we show, using in situ straining in the transmission electron microscope at 93 K (-180 degrees C) that their exceptional damage tolerance involves a synergy of deformation mechanisms, including twinning, glide of partials and full dislocations, extensive cross-slip, and multiple slip activated by dislocation and grain-boundary interactions. In particular, massive cross-slip occurs at the early stages of plastic deformation, thereby promoting multiple slip and dislocation interactions. These results indicate that the reduced intensity of thermal activation of defects at low temperatures and the required increase of applied stress for continued plastic flow, together with high lattice resistance, play a pivotal role in promoting the concurrent operation of multiple deformation mechanisms, which collectively enable the outstanding mechanical properties of these alloys.W [Ding, Qingqing; Fu, Xiaoqian; Li, Jixue; Zhang, Ze; Yu, Qian] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Electron Microscopy, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ding, Qingqing; Fu, Xiaoqian; Li, Jixue; Zhang, Ze; Yu, Qian] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dengke; Zhu, Ting] Georgia Inst Technol, Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Bei, Hongbin; George, Easo P.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Mat Sci & Technol Div, POB 2009, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Gludovatz, Bernd] UNSW Sydney, Sch Mech & Mfg Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [George, Easo P.] Univ Tennessee, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬Æ Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; United States Department of Energy (DOE);√Ω√ø√ø√ø            

Q.V  Creation of skyrmions in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 on (Co/Pd)(n) superlattice  MULTILAYERS; LATTICED Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures, which usually exist in noncentrosymmetric materials where the crystal inversion symmetry breaking generates the so-called Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This requirement unfortunately excludes many important magnetic material classes, including the recently found two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials, which offer unprecedented opportunities for spintronic technology. Using photoemission electron microscopy and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, we investigated and stabilized Neel-type magnetic skyrmion in vdW ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 on top of (Co/Pd)(n) in which the Fe3GeTe2 has a centrosymmetric crystal structure. We demonstrate that the magnetic coupling between the Fe3GeTe2 and the (Co/Pd)(n) could create skyrmions in Fe3GeTe2 without the need of an external magnetic field. Our results open exciting opportunities in spintronic research and the engineering of topologically protected nanoscale features by expanding the group of skyrmion host materials to include these previously unknown vdW magnets.√ä [Yang, M.; Li, Q.; Carlstrom, J.

Applying these principles to artificial, liquid-based systems has led to reconfigurable materials for soft robotics, actuation, and chemical synthesis. However, progress is limited by a lack of synthetic two-dimensional membranes that exhibit tunable mechanical properties over a comparable range to that seen in nature. Here, we show that the bending modulus, B, of thin assemblies of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the oil-water interface can be varied continuously from sub-kBT to 10(6) kBT, by varying the ligands and particles that comprise the NPS. We find extensive departure from continuum behavior, including enormous mechanical anisotropy and a power law relation between B and the buckling spectrum width. Our findings provide a platform for shape-changing liquid devices and motivate new theories for the description of thin-film wrinkling.D [Forth, Joe; Mariano, Andres; Chai, Yu; Toor, Anju; Hasnain, Jaffar; Jiang, Yufeng; Feng, Wenqian; Liu, Xubo; Geissler, Phillip L.; Helms, Brett A.; Ashby, Paul D.; Russell, Thomas P.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Forth, Joe] UCL, Dept Chem, London WC1H 0AJ, England; [Mariano, Andres; Hasnain, Jaffar; Geissler, Phillip L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu; Helms, Brett A.; Ashby, Paul D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chai, Yu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Toor, Anju; Jiang, Yufeng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Xubo; Russell, Thomas P.] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R<     China; [Menon, Narayanan] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Phys, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, JapanG United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of London; University College London; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; City University of Hong Kong; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Tohoku University√ê Russell, TP (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Soft Matter Sci & Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Russell, TP (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.¬™  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DEAC02-05-CH11231]; Ramsay Memorial Fellowship√Ä  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Ramsay Memorial Fellowship This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DEAC02-05-CH11231 within the Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Toward Structuring Liquids program (KCTR16).

End members, PbHfO3 and PbTiO3, were found to possess orthorhombic (Pbam) and tetragonal (P4mm) crystal structures and antiferroelectric and ferroelectric (similar to 87 mu C/cm2) behavior, respectively. PbHf0.75Ti0.25O3 and PbHf0.25Ti0.75O3 solid solutions were both found to be ferroelectric with rhombohedral (R3c, similar to 22 mu C/cm2) and tetragonal (P4mm, similar to 46 mu C/ cm2) structures, respectively. For intermediate PbHf1-xTixO3 compositions (e.g., x = 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, and 0.55), a structural transition was observed from rhombohedral (hafnium-rich) to tetragonal (titanium-rich) phases. These intermediate compositions also exhibited mixed phase structures including R3c, monoclinic (Cm), and P4mm symmetries and, in all cases, were ferroelectric with remanent (5-22 mu C/cm2) and saturation (18.5-36 mu C/cm2) polarization and coercive field (24-34.5 kV/cm) values increasing with x. While the dielectric constant was the largest for PbHf0.6Ti0.4O3, the MPB is thought to be near x = 0.5 after separation of the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the dielectric response. Furthermore, piezoelectric displacement-voltage hysteresis loops were obtained for all chemistries revealing displacement values as good as PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 films in the same geometry. Thereby, the PbHf1-xTixO3 system is a viable alternative to the PbZr1-xTixO3 system offering comparable performance.¬ê [Acharya, Megha; Ling, Handong; Lou, Djamila; Ramesh, Maya; Velarde, Gabriel; Asta, Mark; Persson, Kristin; Martin, Lane W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Acharya, Megha; Ling, Handong; Asta, Mark; Persson, Kristin; Martin, Lane W.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hanrahan, Brendan] DEVCOM US Army Res Lab, Adelphi, MD 20783 USA  lwmartin@berkeley.edu√ó U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Army Research Office [W911NF-21-1-0118, W911NF-21-1-0126]; Air Force; National Science Foundation [DMR-2102895]; Army Research Laboratory, Collaborative for Hierarchical Agile and Responsive Materials (CHARM) [W911NF-19-2-0119]√ü U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Army Research Office; Air Force; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Army Research Laboratory, Collaborative for Hierarchical Agile and Responsive Materials (CHARM) This work was primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 (Materials Project program KC23MP) for the discovery of novel functional materials.

The noncontact microwave probe allows us to observe the Mott insulating state with one hole per moire unit cell that persists for temperatures up to 150 K, consistent with other characterization techniques. In addition, we identify for the first time a Mott insulating state at one electron per moire unit cell. Appreciable inhomogeneity of the correlated states is directly visualized in the heterobilayer region, indicative of local disorders in the moire superlattice potential or electrostatic doping. Our work provides important insights on 2D moire systems down to the microscopic level. [Chu, Zhaodong; Ma, Xuejian; Xu, Zifan; Lai, Keji] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Phys, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Regan, Emma C.; Wang, Danqing; Utama, M.

It remains a significant challenge to control the amount of chemical energy stored in such systems and to utilize it on demand to perform useful work. Here, we show that redox-active molecules compartmentalized in multiphasic structured-liquid devices can be charged and discharged to power a load on an external circuit. The two liquid phases of these devices feature charge-complementary polyelectrolytes that serve a dual purpose: they generate an ionically conductive coacervate membrane at the liquid-liquid interface, providing structural support; they also mitigate active-material crossover between phases via ion pairing with the oppositely charged anolyte and catholyte active materials. Structured-liquid batteries enabled by this design were rechargeable over hundreds of hours. We envision that these devices may be integrated with soft electronics to enable functional circuits for smart textiles, medical implants, and wearables.√´ [Yan, Jiajun; Zettl, Alex; Russell, Thomas P.; Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yan, Jiajun] ShanghaiTech Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201210, Peoples R China; [Baird, Michael A.; Popple, Derek C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Popple, Derek C.; Zettl, Alex] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zettl, Alex] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Russell, Thomas P.] Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Helms, Brett A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; ShanghaiTech University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory√Ö  Helms, BA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Helms, BA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  ; Yan, Ji<    ajun/C-4074-2015A  Helms, Brett/0000-0003-3925-4174; Yan, Jiajun/0000-0003-3286-3268 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy Integration and Optimization of Novel Ion Conducting Solids (IONICS) program [DE-AR0000774]‚Ä∫ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy Integration and Optimization of Novel Ion Conducting Solids (IONICS) program¬æ This work was supported primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

Their unconventional compositions and chemical structures hold promise for achieving unprecedented combinations of mechanical properties(3-8). Rational design of such alloys hinges on an understanding of the composition-structure-property relationships in a near-infinite compositional space(9,10). Here we use atomic-resolution chemical mapping to reveal the element distribution of the widely studied face-centred cubic CrMnFeCoNi Cantor alloy(2) and of a new face-centred cubic alloy, CrFeCoNiPd. In the Cantor alloy, the distribution of the five constituent elements is relatively random and uniform. By contrast, in the CrFeCoNiPd alloy, in which the palladium atoms have a markedly different atomic size and electronegativity from the other elements, the homogeneity decreases considerably; all five elements tend <    to show greater aggregation, with a wavelength of incipient concentration waves(11,12) as small as 1 to 3 nanometres. The resulting nanoscale alternating tensile and compressive strain fields lead to considerable resistance to dislocation glide. In situ transmission electron microscopy during straining experiments reveals massive dislocation cross-slip from the early stage of plastic deformation, resulting in strong dislocation interactions between multiple slip systems. These deformation mechanisms in the CrFeCoNiPd alloy, which differ markedly from those in the Cantor alloy and other face-centred cubic high-entropy alloys, are promoted by pronounced fluctuations in composition and an increase in stacking-fault energy, leading to higher yield strength without compromising strain hardening and tensile ductility. Mapping atomic-scale element distributions opens opportunities for understanding chemical structures and thus providing a basis for tuning composition and atomic configurations to obtain outstanding mechanical properties.s [Ding, Qingqing; Fu, Xiaoqian; Chen, Sijing; Bei, Hongbin; Li, Jixue; Zhang, Ze; Yu, Qian] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Electron Microscopy, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ding, Qingqing; Fu, Xiaoqian; Chen, Sijing; Bei, Hongbin; Li, Jixue; Zhang, Ze; Yu, Qian] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yin; Chen, Dengke; Wen, Minru; Zhu, Ting] Georgia Inst Technol, Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Chen, Xiao; Wei, Fei] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Key Lab Green Chem React Engn & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gu, Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Natl Lab Condensed Matter Phys, Inst Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gu, Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Quantum Matter, Inst Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yanfei] Univ Tennessee, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Gao, Yanfei] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Mat Sci & Technol Div, Oak Ridge, TN USA; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ritchie, Robert O.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√≤ Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley Yu, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Electron Microscopy, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Yu, Q (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Silicon Mat, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Zhu, T (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Ritchie, RO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.=  ting.zhu@me.gatech.edu; roritchie@lbl.gov; yu_qian@zju.edu.cn¬ç W e i ,   F e i / H - 4 6 7 4 - 2 0 1 2 ;   H‚Äì,   Sf/ A A E - 8 6 1 9 - 2 0 2 1 ;   Z h a n g ,   Y i n / U - 8 6 2 4 - 2 0 1 9 ;   G u ,   L i n / D - 9 6 3 1 - 2 0 1 1 ;   G a o ,   Y a n f e i / F - 9 0 3 4 - 2 0 1 0 ;   R i t c h i e ,   R o b e r t   O / A - 8 0 6 6 - 2 0 0 8 √ù W e i ,   F e i / 0 0 0 0 - 0 0 0 2 - 1 4 2 2 - 9 7 8 4 ;   H‚Äì,   Sf/ 0 0 0 0 - 0 0 0 3 - 1 1 0 4 - 6 1 4 6 ;   Z h a n g ,   Y i n / 0 0 0 0 - 0 0 0 2 - 9 1 9 4 - 2 2 3 3 ;   G u ,   L i n / 0 0 0 0 - 0 0 0 2 - 7 5 0 4 - 0 3 1 X ;   G a o ,   Y a n f e i / 0 0 0 0 - 0 0 0 3 - 2 0 8 2 - 8 5 7 X ;   R i t c h i e ,   R o b e r t   O / 0 0 0 0 - 0 0 0 2 - 0 5 0 1 - 6 9 9 8 ;   B e i ,   H o n g b i n / 0 0 0 0 - 0 0 0 3 - 0 2 8 3 - 7 9 9 0 ‚Äô National Natural Science Foundation of China [51671168]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0208200]; 111 project [B16042]; State Key Program for Basic Research in China [2015CB659300]; US National Science Foundation [DMR-1810720]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division;  [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√™ National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; 111 project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); State Key Program for Basic Research in China; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); √• Q.Y. was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51671168), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0208200), 111 project under grant no.

Utilizing the electron valley degree of freedom as an information carrier, valleytronics has recently emerged as a promising platform for developments in computation and communication(4-7). Thus far, explorations of valleytronics have focused on optoelectronic and magnetic means(8-16). Here, we realize valley-mechanical coupling in a resonator made of the monolayer semiconductor MoS2 and transduce valley information into mechanical states. The coupling is achieved by exploiting the magnetic moment of valley carriers with a magnetic field gradient. We optically populate the valleys and observe the resulting mechanical actuation using laser interferometry. We are thus able to control the valley-mechanical interaction by adjusting the pump-laser light, the magnetic field gradient and temperature. Our work paves the way for realizing valley-actuated devices and hybrid valley quantum systems.H [Li, Hao-Kun; Fong, King Yan; Zhu, Hanyu; Li, Quanwei; Wang, Siqi; Yang, Sui; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiang] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Xiang] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China√è  National Science Foundation (NSF); University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Hong Kong Zhang, X (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zhang, X (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zhang, X (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.‚Äπ  Zhang, Xiang/F-6905-2011; Li, Hao-Kun/AAN-8834-2021; Wang, Yuan/HHC-1520-2022; Wang, Yuan/F-7211-2011; wangwangwang, yuanyaun/HHN-6432-2022`  Wang, Yuan/0000-0001-7892-2812; Zhu, Hanyu/0000-0003-3376-5352; Zhang, Xiang/0000-0002-3272-894XC US Department of Energy, Office of<     Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DEAC02-05-CH11231]; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) [OSR-2016-CRG5-2996]; Office of Naval Research (ONR) MURI programme [N00014-13-1-0631]1 US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Office of Sponsored Research (OSR); Office of Naval Research (ONR) MURI programmeP We acknowledge support from the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract number DEAC02-05-CH11231 (van der Waals Heterostructures Program, KCWF16) for theory, device fabrication and data analysis; from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) under award number OSR-2016-CRG5-2996 for sample preparation; and from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) MURI programme under grant number N00014-13-1-0631 for mechanical design and measurements.	  1749-4885	  1749-4893  NAT PHOTONICS  Nat.

However, the practical utility of these nanocrystals has been hindered by their poor air stability, which induces undesired changes in the optical and electronic properties. An understanding of the degradation of PbSe nanocrystals when they are exposed to air is critical for improving the stability and enhancing their applications. Here, we use in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an environmental cell connected to air to study PbSe nanocrystal degradation triggered by air exposure. We have also conducted a series of complementary studies, including in situ environmental TEM study of PbSe nanocrystals exposed to pure oxygen and PbSe nanocrystals in H2O using a liquid cell, and ex situ experiments, such as O-2 plasma treatment and thermal heating of PbSe nanocrystals under different air exposure. Our in situ observations reveal that when PbSe nanocrystals are exposed to air (or oxygen) under electron beam irradiation, they experience a series of changes, including shape evolution of individual nanocrystals with the cuboid intermediates, coalescence between nanocrystals, and formation of PbSe thin films through drastic solid-state fusion. Further studies show that the PbSe thin films transform into an amorphous Pb rich phase or eventually pure Pb, which suggest that Se reacts with oxygen and can be evaporated under electron beam illumination. These various in situ and ex situ experimental results indicate that PbSe nanocrystal degradation in air is initiated by the dissociation and removal of ligands from the PbSe nanocrystal surface.≈∏ [Peng, Xinxing; Yin, Zu-Wei; Liao, Hong-Gang; Sun, Shi-Gang] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Peng, Xinxing; Wang, Yu; Shangguan, Junyi; Zhang, Qiubo; Yu, Lei; Yin, Zu-Wei; Zheng, Wenjing; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Abelson, Alex; Qian, Caroline; Law, Matt] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Abelson, Alex; Qian, Caroline; Law, Matt] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Bustillo, Karen C.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Elect Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Yu; Shangguan, Junyi; Yu, Lei; Zheng, Wenjing; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Guo, Xuyun] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China¬ù Xiamen University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Hong Kong Polytechnic University{ Liao, HG (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Zheng, HM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.‚Äô  Wang, Yu/D-7308-2017; McCoy, Tina/P-3402-2019; Yu, Lei/P-1071-2019; Peng, Xinxing/U-4102-2019; GUO, Xuyun/K-8714-2015; Liao, Hong-Gang/T-2991-2019' Wang, Yu/0000-0002-9029-1846; Yu, Lei/0000-0002-3975-8930; GUO, Xuyun/0000-0003-0365-7545; Liao, Hong-Gang/0000-0003-2622-9842; Peng, Xinxing/0000-0002-7077-8454; Yin, Zuwei/0000-0002-0728-1154; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Law, Matt/0000-0001-7645-9908; Qian, Caroline/0000-0002-6098-8327¬§ U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; UC Office of the President under the UC Laboratory Fees Research Program Collaborative Research and Training Award [LFR-17-477148]; China Scholarship Council; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]√ö U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); UC Office of the President under the UC Laboratory Fees Research Program Collaborative Research and Training Award; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))¬≤ This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the in situ TEM program (KC22ZH) program.

T<    heoretical models suggest that magnetic Hopfions can be stabilized in frustrated or chiral magnetic systems, and target skymions can be transformed into Hopfions by adapting their perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, but their experimental verification has been elusive so far. Here, we present an experimental study of magnetic Hopfions that are created in Ir/Co/Pt multilayers shaped into nanoscale disks, known to host target skyrmions. To characterize three-dimensional spin textures that distinguish Hopfions from target skyrmions magnetic images are recorded with surface-sensitive X-ray photoemission electron microscopy and bulk-sensitive soft X-ray transmission microscopy using element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism effects as magnetic contrast. These results could stimulate further investigations of Hopfions and their potential application in three-dimensional spintronics devices. In three dimensions, magnetic Skyrmions can form extended strings. By connecting the ends of a Skyrmionic string, a magnetic Hopfion is formed. Here, the authors present experimental evidence for the appearance of Hopfions, a topological soliton defined by a Hopf number, in a magnetic system. [Kent, Noah; Reynolds, Neal; Raftrey, David; Campbell, Ian T.

A prominent approach to realize Floquet states is based on the optical Stark effect. Previous studies on the optical Stark effect often treated the excited state in solids as free quasi-particles(3,7-12). However, exciton-exciton interactions can be sizeably enhanced in low-dimensional systems and may lead to light-matter interactions that are qualitatively different from those in the non-interacting picture. Here we use monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) as a model system to demonstrate that the driving optical field can couple a hierarchy of excitonic states, and the many-body inter-valley biexciton state plays a dominant role in the optical Stark effect. Specifically, the exciton-biexciton coupling in monolayer MoSe2 breaks down the valley selection rules based on the non-interacting exciton picture. The photon-dressed excitonic states exhibit an energy redshift, splitting or blueshift as the driving photon frequency varies below the exciton transition. We determine a binding energy of 21 meV for the inter-valley biexciton and a transition dipole moment of 9.3 debye for the exciton-biexciton transition. Our study reveals the crucial role of many-body effects in coherent light-matter interaction in atomically thin two-dimensional materials.‚Äù [Yong, Chaw-Keong; Horng, Jason; Wang, Alex; Yang, Chan-Shan; Lin, Chung-Kuan; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shen, Yuxia; Cai, Hui; Tongay, Sefaattin] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ USA; [Zhao, Shilong] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Watanabe, Kenji; Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Feng] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬° University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Tsinghua University; National Institute for Materials Science; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory~ Yong, CK; Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA./  chawkeong@berkeley.edu; fengwang76@berkeley.edu¬¨  Tongay, Sefaattin/ACQ-5306-2022; Tongay, Sefaattin/E-<    6388-2011; Watanabe, Kenji/ABB-2135-2021; Cai, Hui/AAA-3998-2019; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015; Yang, Chan-Shan/GLU-8669-2022¬Æ  Tongay, Sefaattin/0000-0001-8294-984X; Watanabe, Kenji/0000-0003-3701-8119; wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Yong, Chaw Keong/0000-0002-6470-1274; Cai, Hui/0000-0003-0848-3097 US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Science Foundation EFRI programme [EFMA-1542741]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP15K21722, JP25106006]; NSF DMR [1552220 NSF CAREER]¬Ø US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation EFRI programme; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); NSF DMR(National Science Foundation (NSF))a This work was primarily supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

Q.Q  Creation and annihilation of topological meron pairs in in-plane magnetized filmsF  SKYRMION LATTICE; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; STATES; CORE; MICROSCOPY; DYNAMICS√Ø Merons which are topologically equivalent to one-half of skyrmions can exist only in pairs or groups in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) systems. The recent discovery of meron lattice in chiral magnet Co8Zn9Mn3 raises the immediate challenging question that whether a single meron pair, which is the most fundamental topological structure in any 2D meron systems, can be created and stabilized in a continuous FM film? Utilizing winding number conservation, we develop a new method to create and stabilize a single pair of merons in a continuous Py film by local vortex imprinting from a Co disk. By observing the created meron pair directly within a magnetic field, we determine its topological structure unambiguously and explore the topological effect in its creation and annihilation processes. Our work opens a pathway towards developing and controlling topological structures in general magnetic systems without the restriction of perpendicular anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.√™ [Gao, N.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Microelect, Key Lab Microelect Devices & Integrated Technol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Gao, N.; Yang, M.; Li, Q.; Wang, T.

However, details of nanocrystal morphological changes during superlattice phase transitions are largely unknown due to the lack of direct observation. Here, we report the dynamic deformability of PbSe semiconductor nanocrystals during superlattice phase transitions that are driven by ligand displacement. Real-time high-resolution imaging with liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy reveals that following ligand removal, the individual PbSe nanocrystals experience drastic directional shape deformation when the spacing between nanocrystals reaches 2 to 4 nm. The deformation can be completely recovered when two nanocrystals move apart or it can be retained when they attach. The large deformation, which is responsible for the structural defects in the epitaxially fused nanocrystal superlattice, may arise from internanocrystal dipole-dipole interactions.} [Wang, Yu; Peng, Xinxing; Xiao, Penghao; Yu, Lei; Wang, Lin-Wang; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Yu; Yu, Lei; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Peng, Xinxing] Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Abelson, Alex; Qian, Caroline; Law, Matt] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Ophus, Colin; Ercius, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√á  wang, lili/HDL-7210-2022; Ophus, Colin/P-5390-2019; wang, lin/HHM-2225-2022; Wang, Yu/D-7308-2017; Peng, Xinxing/U-4102-2019; wang, lin/GSE-3040-2022; Ercius, Peter/AAN-2870-2020; Yu, Lei/P-1071-2019+ Ophus, Colin/0000-0003-2348-8558; Wang, Yu/0000-0002-9029-1846; Ercius, Peter/0000-0002-6762-9976; Yu, Lei/0000-0002-3975-8930; Qian, Caroline/0000-0002-6098-8327; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Wang, Lin-Wang/0000-0001-7061-2692; Peng, Xinxing/0000-0002-7077-8454; Law, Matt/0000-0001-7645-9908r U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; UC Office of the President under the UC Laboratory Fees Research Program Collaborative Research and Training Award [LFR-17-477148]; China Scholarship Council; Office of Science, BES of the DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]¬® U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); UC Office of the President under the UC Laboratory Fees Research Program Collaborative Research and Training Award; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Office of Science, BES of the DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))‚Äò This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences, and Engineering Division under contract no.

When the unknown structure is large, structure solution can become a virtually intractable problem using standard structure solution methodologies, especially when the space group cannot be unambiguously resolved. One such system is the promising Na-ion battery cathode material Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3, whose high-temperature and room-temperature structures were previously solved, but whose more complex low-temperature structure could not be determined. Here, a novel materials genomic approach is demonstrated for the solution of the unknown 100 K structure of Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3 in which enumeration methods are first used to generate a large number (similar to 3000) of trial structures based on plausible orderings of Na ions and then automated Rietveld refinements are carried out to optimize each of these trial structures. Based on both the analysis of the ensemble of optimized trial structures and the density functional theory energy minimization of selected trial structures, the 100 K structure of Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3 is best described as belonging to the space group A2(1)am with unit cell dimensions of a = 9.01928(4), b = 27.1379(1), and c = 10.73307(5). The 100 K unit cell has a large volume of 2627.07(2) angstrom(3) with Z = 12 and 33 independent crystallographic sites (9 Na, 3 V, 3 P, 12 O, and 6 F) that is 3x and 6x larger than the room- and high-temperature polymorphs of this phase, respectively. The novel methods described here will be generally applicable for the solution of the complex cation-ordered structures that commonly occur for battery materials.¬Æ [Mattei, Gerard S.; Khalifah, Peter G.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Mattei, Gerard S.; Khalifah, Peter G.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Chem Div, Upton, NY 11793 USA; [Dagdelen, John M.; Bianchini, Matteo; Ceder, Gerbrand; Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ganose, Alex M.; Jain, Anubhav; Ceder, Gerbrand; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Suard, Emmanuelle] Inst Laue Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Fauth, Francois] CELLS ALBA Synchrotron, Barcelona 08290, Spain; [Masquelier, Christian] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Lab Reactivite & Chim Solides, CNRS, UMR 7314, F-80039 Amiens, France; [Masquelier, Christian; Croguennec, Laurence] FR CNRS 3459, RS2E, Reseau Francais Stockage Electrochim Energie, F-80039 Amiens, France; [Croguennec, Laurence] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, Bordeaux INP, ICMCB,UMR 5026, F-33600 Pessac, France‚Ñ¢ State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); Picardie Universites; Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux¬µ  Khalifah, PG (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;Khalifah, PG (corresponding author), Brookhaven Natl Lab, Chem Div, Upton, NY 11793 USA.  kpete@bnl.gov¬æ  Ganose, Alex/AAS-3452-2020; Bianchini, Matteo/U-1043-2019; Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; Fauth, Francois/K-9643-2014; SUARD, Emmanuelle/E-9579-2012; Croguennec, Laurence/R-9512-2016y Ganose, Alex/0000-0002-4486-3321; Bianchini, Matteo/0000-0003-4034-7706; Fauth, Francois/0000-0001-9<    465-3106; Mattei, Gerard/0000-0003-3087-7762; Ceder, Gerbrand/0000-0001-9275-3605; Jain, Anubhav/0000-0001-5893-9967; MASQUELIER, Christian/0000-0001-7289-1015; Khalifah, Peter/0000-0002-2216-0377; SUARD, Emmanuelle/0000-0001-5966-5929; Croguennec, Laurence/0000-0002-3018-0992‚Ä∫  U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-SC0012704, DE-AC0205CH11231]A This work was intellectually led and supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under contract no.

Moire superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures can host novel correlated quantum phenomena due to the interplay of narrow moire flat bands and strong, long-range Coulomb interactions(1-9). However, microscopic knowledge of the atomically reconstructed moire superlattice and resulting flat bands is still lacking, which is critical for fundamental understanding and control of the correlated moire phenomena. Here we quantitatively study the moire flat bands in three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed WSe2/WS2 moire superlattices by comparing scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) of high-quality exfoliated TMD heterostructure devices with ab initio simulations of TMD moire superlattices. A strong 3D buckling reconstruction accompanied by large in-plane strain redistribution is identified in our WSe2/WS2 moire heterostructures. STS imaging demonstrates that this results in a remarkably narrow and highly localized K-point moire flat band at the valence band edge of the heterostructure. A series of moire flat bands are observed at different energies that exhibit varying degrees of localization. Our observations contradict previous simplified theoretical models but agree quantitatively with ab initio simulations that fully capture the 3D structural reconstruction. Our results reveal that the strain redistribution and 3D buckling in TMD heterostructures dominate the effective moire potential and the corresponding moire flat bands at the Brillouin zone K points.c [Li, Hongyuan; Li, Shaowei; Naik, Mit H.; Xie, Jingxu; Li, Xinyu; Wang, Jiayin; Regan, Emma; Wang, Danqing; Zhao, Wenyu; Zhao, Sihan; Kahn, Salman; Zettl, Alex; Louie, Steven G.; Wang, Feng; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Hongyuan; Regan, Emma; Wang, Danqing] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Grp Appl Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Hongyuan; Li, Shaowei; Naik, Mit H.; Regan, Emma; Kahn, Salman; Zettl, Alex; Louie, Steven G.; Wang, Feng; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94550 USA; [Li, Shaowei; Zettl, Alex; Wang, Feng; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy Nano Sci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Shaowei; Zettl, Alex; Wang, Feng; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yumigeta, Kentaro; Blei, Mark; Tongay, Sefaattin] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ USA; [Taniguchi, Takashi] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Int Ctr Mat Nanoarchitecton, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Watanabe, Kenji] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Res Ctr Funct Mat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan√∫ University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; National Institute for Materials Science; National Institute for Materials Science√ü Li, SW; Louie, SG; Wang, F; Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Li, SW; Louie, SG; Wang, F; Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94550 USA.;Li, SW; Wang, F; Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy Nano Sci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Li, SW; Wang, F; Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.^  swli@berkeley.edu; sglouie@berkeley.edu; fengwang76@berkeley.edu; crommie@physics.berkeley.edu¬•  Tongay, Sefaattin/ACQ-5306-2022; Zhao, Sihan/AAL-3313-2021; Li, Shaowei/AAH-5717-2021; Naik, Mit/GPG-1670-2022; Tongay, Sefaattin/E-6388-2011; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015¬¶  Tongay, Sefaattin/0000-0001-8294-984X; Zhao, Sihan/0000-0003-2162-734X; Li, Shaowei/0000-0002-4627-626X; wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Li, Xinyu/0000-0003-4345-6270√≤ Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the US Department of Energy under the van der Waals heterostructure program [KCWF16, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; US Army Research Office under MURI award [W911NF-17-1-0312]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1807233, DMR-1926004, DMR 1552220, DMR 1904716, CMMI 1933214, ACI-1053575, OAC-1818253]; Elemental Strategy Initiative by the MEXT, Japan [JPMXP0112101001]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP20H00354]; CREST, JST [JPMJCR15F3]; Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program; Kavli ENSI Heising Simons Junior Fellowship; Office of Science of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231];  [DOE-SC0020653]‚Ñ¢ Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the US Department of Energy under the van der Waals heterostructure program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Army Research Office under MURI award; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Elemental Strategy Initiative by the MEXT, Japan; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); CREST, JST(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)); Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program; Kavli ENSI Heising Simons Junior Fellowship; Office of Science of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); K This work was supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the US Department of Energy under the van der Waals heterostructure program (KCWF16), contract number DE-AC02-05CH11231 (device electrode preparation, STM spectroscopy, DFT calculations and theoretical analy<    sis).

Despite this critical need, there are few studies on the strain evolution of magnetic order in BiFeO3 films. Here, in (110)-oriented BiFeO3 films, we reveal that while the polarization structure remains relatively unaffected, strain can continuously tune the orientation of the antiferromagnetic-spin axis across a wide angular space, resulting in an unexpected deviation of the classical perpendicular relationship between the antiferromagnetic axis and the polarization. Calculations suggest that this evolution arises from a competition between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and single-ion anisotropy wherein the former dominates at small strains and the two are comparable at large strains. Finally, strong coupling between the BiFeO3 and the ferromagnet Co0.9Fe0.1 exists such that the magnetic anisotropy of the ferromagnet can be effectively controlled by engineering the orientation of the antiferromagnetic-spin axis.¬≥ [Chen, Zuhuang] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zuhuang; Tang, Yunlong; Dedon, Liv R.; Zhang, Lei; Huang, Yen-Lin; Prasad, Bhagwati; Clarkson, James D.; Das, Sujit; Ramesh, Ramamoorthy; Martin, Lane W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Zhanghui; Klewe, Christoph; Ramesh, Ramamoorthy; Wang, Lin-Wang; Martin, Lane W.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kuo, Chang-Yang; Hu, Zhiwei; Tjeng, Liu-Hao] Max Planck Inst Chem Phys Solids, Nothnitzer Str 40, D-01187 Dresden, Germany; [Kuo, Chang-Yang] Natl Synchrotron Radiat Res Ctr, 101 Hsin Ann Rd, Hsinchu 30076, Taiwan; [Li, Qian; Yang, Mengmeng; Qiu, Z.

In two-dimensional systems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly suppressed by thermal fluctuations, according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem(5); however, these thermal fluctuations can be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy. Previous efforts, based on defect and composition engineering(6-10), or the proximity effect, introduced magnetic responses only locally or extrinsically. Here we report intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers, as revealed by scanning magneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In this magnetically soft, two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet, we achieve unprecedented control of the transition temperature (between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states) using very small fields (smaller than 0.3 tesla). This result is in contrast to the insensitivity of the transition temperature to magnetic fields in the three-dimensional regime. We found that the small applied field leads to an effective anisotropy that is much greater than the near-zero magnetocrystalline anisotropy, opening up a large spin-wave excitation gap. We explain the observed phenomenon using renormalized spin-wave theory and conclude that the unusual field dependence of the transition temperature is a hallmark of soft, two-dimensional ferromagnetic van der Waals crystals. Cr2Ge2Te6 is a nearly ideal two-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet and so will be useful for studying fundamental spin behaviours, opening the door to exploring new applications such as ultra-compact spintronics.E [Gong, Cheng; Xia, Yang; Bao, Wei; Wang, Chenzhe; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSEC, 3112 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Lin; Stern, Alex; Xia, Jing] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Phys & Astron, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Li, Zhenglu; Cao, Ting; Qiu, Z.

The two-dimensional spin liquid candidate 1T-TaSe2 has charge density modulations that may be caused by an unstable spinon Fermi surface. Two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnets are predicted under some conditions to exhibit a quantum spin liquid ground state with no energy barrier to create emergent, fractionali<    zed spinon excitations that carry spin but no charge. Materials that realize this kind of spin liquid are expected to have a low-energy behaviour described by a spinon Fermi surface. Directly imaging the resulting spinons, however, is difficult due to their chargeless nature. Here we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to image density waves consistent with the predictions of spinon density modulation arising from a spinon Fermi surface instability in single-layer 1T-TaSe2. We confirm the existence of a triangular lattice of localized spins in this material by contacting it with a metallic 1H-TaSe2 substrate and measuring the Kondo effect. Spectroscopic imaging of isolated single-layer 1T-TaSe2 reveals long-wavelength super-modulations at Hubbard band energies, consistent with the predicted behaviour of itinerant spinons. These super-modulations allow the direct experimental measurement of the spinon Fermi wavevector, in good agreement with theoretical predictions for a two-dimensional quantum spin liquid.Z [Ruan, Wei; Chen, Yi; Tsai, Hsin-Zon; Wu, Meng; Jia, Caihong; Wang, Feng; Louie, Steven G.; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ruan, Wei; Chen, Yi; Lee, Ryan L.; Wu, Meng; Kahn, Salman; Liou, Franklin; Jia, Caihong; Aikawa, Andrew; Wang, Feng; Louie, Steven G.; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ruan, Wei] Fudan Univ, Dept Phys, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Tang, Shujie; Hwang, Jinwoong; Shen, Zhi-Xun] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford Inst Mat & Energy Sci, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Tang, Shujie; Hwang, Jinwoong; Shen, Zhi-Xun] Stanford Univ, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Tang, Shujie; Shen, Zhi-Xun] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys & Appl Phys, Geballe Lab Adv Mat, Stanford, CA USA; [Tang, Shujie; Hwang, Jinwoong; Ryu, Hyejin; Mo, Sung-Kwan] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA USA; [Tang, Shujie] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Superconducting Elect, Shanghai Inst Microsyst & Informat Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Tang, Shujie] Shanghai Tech Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hwang, Jinwoong; Hwang, Choongyu] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Phys, Busan, South Korea; [Tsai, Hsin-Zon] Shenzhen Univ, Int Collaborat Lab 2D Mat Optoelect Sci & Technol, Engn Technol Res Ctr 2D Mat Informat Funct Device, Minist Educ, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Ryu, Hyejin] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Spintron, Seoul, South Korea; [Jia, Caihong] Henan Univ, Ctr Topol Funct Mat, Henan Key Lab Photovolta Mat, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; [Wang, Feng; Crommie, Michael F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Feng; Crommie, Michael F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Choi, Yongseong] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Lee, Patrick A.] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAw United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Fudan University; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; Stanford University; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Microsystem & Information Technology, CAS; ShanghaiTech University; Pusan National University; Shenzhen University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Henan University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)‚Äû Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy NanoSci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Crommie, MF (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.e  Wu, Meng/AAL-6311-2021; Mo, Sung-Kwan/F-3489-2013; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/J-1682-2016√Ä  Wu, Meng/0000-0002-9277-1173; Mo, Sung-Kwan/0000-0003-0711-8514; wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Tsai, Hsin-Zon/0000-0003-2097-0170; Chen, Yi/0000-0001-8564-3600; Ruan, Wei/0000-0002-0944-456Xj Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, US Department of Energy (DOE) [KCWF16, DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [DMR-1807233, DMR-1926004]; Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, DOE; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, DOE [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; DOE Basic Energy Science [DE-FG02-03ER46076]; CPSF-CAS Joint Foundation for Excellent Postdoctoral Fellows; NRF - Korean government (MSIT) [2021R1A2C1004266]; Shenzhen Peacock Plan [827-000113, KQJSCX20170727100802505, KQTD2016053112042971]‚Ä° Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, US Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Basic Energy Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); CPSF-CAS Joint Foundation for Excellent Postdoctoral Fellows; NRF - Korean government (MSIT); Shenzhen Peacock Plan‚Ñ¢ We thank D.-H.

However, detailed experimental phonon spectra are available only for a limited number of materials, which hinders the large-scale analysis of vibrational properties and their derived quantities. In this work, we perform ab initio calculations of the full phonon dispersion and vibrational density of states for 1521 semiconductor compounds in the harmonic approximation based on density functional perturbation theory.

However, the limited synthetic chemistry to access such materials and the lack of mechanistic understanding of carrier mobility greatly hinder their practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of three chemically stable polyarylether-based metallophthalocyanine COFs (PAE-PcM, M = Cu, Ni, and Co) and facile in situ growth of their thin films on various substrates (i.e., SiO2/Si, ITO, quartz) under solvothermal conditions. We show that PAE-PcM COFs thin films with van der Waals layered structures exhibit p-type semiconducting properties with the intrinsic mobility up to similar to 19.4 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 4 orders of magnitude of increase in conductivity for PAE-PcCu film (0.2 S m(-1)) after iodine doping. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the carrier transport in the framework is anisotropic, with the out-of-plane hole transport along columnar stacked phthalocyanine more favorable. Furthermore, PAE-PcCo shows the redox behavior maximumly contributes similar to 88.5% of its capacitance performance, giving rise to a high surface area normalized capacitance of similar to 19 mu F cm(-2). Overall, this work not only offers fundamental understandings of electronic properties of polyarylether-based 2D COFs but also paves the way for their energy-related applications.√° [Yang, Chongqing; Li, Xinle; Sun, Bing; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Jian] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jiang, Kaiyue; Chen, Cheng; Zhuang, Xiaodong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Mesoentropy Matter Lab, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Qi; Li, Xinle; Zheng, Haimei; Reimer, Jeffrey A.; Liu, Yi] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Xinle] Clark Atlanta Univ, Dept Chem, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA; [Mao, Haiyan; Reimer, Jeffrey A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhong, Wenkai] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhong, Wenkai] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Frontiers Sci Ctr Transformat Mol, In Situ Ctr Phys Sci, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Wenkai] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Ctr Hydrogen Sci, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Sun, Bing] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China√ç United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Clark Atlanta University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; China University of Geosciencesa  Zhang, J (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.  jianzhang@lbl.govC  Zhang, Jian/M-9978-2019; Sun, Bing/G-8210-2017; Liu, yi/A-<    3384-2008√Ç  Zhang, Jian/0000-0003-0274-0814; Sun, Bing/0000-0001-5917-3094; Liu, yi/0000-0002-3954-6102; Zheng, Haimei/0000-0003-3813-4170; Zhu, Jinhui/0000-0001-7685-5142; Zhong, Wenkai/0000-0001-8333-48982 Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy; Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NSFC [51973114, 21720102002]; Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering [DE-AC02-76SF00515]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-AC02-05-CH11231, KC3104]≈∏ Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE))G Work at the Molecular Foundry and Advanced Light Source was supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy, and by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under U.S. Department of Energy contract no.

Specifically, we focus on electronic states energetically proximate to Van Hove singularities (VHSs), where a large density of states promotes different interaction-induced symmetry-breaking electronic orders. To resolve the Fermi surface near VHSs, we construct a fermionic hot-spot model and demonstrate that a perpendicular electric field can tune different nesting structures of the Fermi surface. Subsequently, we apply a renormalization group analysis to describe the low-energy phase diagrams of our model under both short-range repulsive interactions as well as realistic (long-range) Coulomb interactions. Our analysis shows instabilities towards either intervalley coherent metallic phases or superconducting phases. The dominant pairing channel depends crucially on the nature of Fermi surface nesting-repulsive Coulomb interaction favors spin-singlet d-wave pairing for relatively small displacement field and spin-singlet i-wave pairing for larger displacement field. We argue that the phase diagram of RTG can be well-understood by modeling the realistic Coulomb interaction as the sum of repulsive density-density interaction and ferromagnetic spin-triplet intervalley coherence (IVC) Hund's coupling, while phonon-mediated electronic interactions have a negligible effect on this system, in sharp contrast to twisted graphene multilayers. [Lu, Da-Chuan; You, Yi-Zhuang] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Wang, Taige; Chatterjee, Shubhayu] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Taige] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA√ò  University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryX  Lu, DC (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, San Diego, CA 92093 USA.k  Wang, Taige/0000-0001-7227-915X; Chatterjee, Shubhayu/0000-0001-9599-8456; Lu, Da-Chuan/0000-0001-6453-2602√®  U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [W911NF-17-1- 0323]; ARO; U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research;  [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]√©  U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); ARO; U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research; ‚Ä° We acknowledge helpful discussions with Seth Whitsitt and Michael P.

Crystallization of phase-pure alpha-FAPbI(3) conventionally requires high-temperature thermal annealing at 150 degrees C whilst the obtained alpha-FAPbI(3) is metastable at room temperature. Here, aerosol-assisted crystallization (AAC) is reported, which converts yellow delta-FAPbI(3) into black alpha-FAPbI(3) at only 100 degrees C using precursor solutions containing only lead iodide and formamidinium iodide with no chemical additives. The obtained alpha-FAPbI(3) exhibits remarkably enhanced stability compared to the 150 degrees C annealed counterparts, in combination with improvements in film crystallinity and photoluminescence yield. Using X-ray diffraction, X-ray scattering, and density functional theory simulation, it is identified that relaxation of residual tensile strains, achieved through the lower annealing temperature and post-crystallization crystal growth during AAC, is the key factor that facilitates the formation of phase-stable alpha-FAPbI(3). This overcomes the strain-induced lattice expansion that is known to cause the metastability of alpha-FAPbI(3). Accordingly, pure FAPbI(3) p-i-n solar cells are reported, facilitated by the low-temperature (<= 100 degrees C) AAC processing, which demonstrates increases of both power conversion efficiency and operational stability compared to devices fabricated using 150 degrees C annealed films.≈Ω [Du, Tian; Macdonald, Thomas J.; Mohan, Lokeshwari; Whiteley, Richard; Briscoe, Joe] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Engn & Mat Sci, London E1 4NS, England; [Du, Tian; Macdonald, Thomas J.; Mohan, Lokeshwari; Whiteley, Richard; Briscoe, Joe] Queen Mary Univ London, Mat Res Inst, London E1 4NS, England; [Du, Tian; Jiang, Zhongyao; Mohan, Lokeshwari; Lin, Chieh-Ting; McLachlan, Martyn A.] Imperial Coll, Dept Mat, London W12 0BZ, England; [Du, Tian; Macdonald, Thomas J.; Jiang, Zhongyao; Mohan, Lokeshwari; Xu, Weidong; Lin, Chieh-Ting; Min, Ganghong; Haque, Saif A.; Durrant, James R.; McLachlan, Martyn A.] Imperial Coll, Ctr Processable Elect, London W12 0BZ, England; [Macdonald, Thomas J.; Xu, Weidong; Min, Ganghong; Haque, Saif A.; Durrant, James R.] Imperial Coll, Dept Chem, London W12 0BZ, England; [Yang, Ruo Xi] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Meng] Henan Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr High Efficiency D, Key Lab Special Funct Mat,Minist Educ, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Li, Meng] Henan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Nano Funct Mat & Applicat, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Su, Zhenhuang; Gao, Xingyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Appl Phys, Shanghai Adv Res Inst, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiat Facil SSRF Zhangjiang, 239 Zhangheng Rd, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China; [Durrant, James R.] Swansea Univ, Coll Engn, SPECIFIC IKC, Swansea SA2 7AX, W Glam, Wales; [Persson, Kristin A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 210 Hearst Min Mem Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAC University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Imperial College London; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Henan University; Henan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, CAS; Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, CAS; Swansea University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley‚Äö Du, T; Briscoe, J (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Engn & Mat Sci, London E1 4NS, England.;Du, T; Briscoe, J (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Mat Res Inst, London E1 4NS, England.;Du, T (corresponding author), Imperial Coll, Dept Mat, London W12 0BZ, England.;Du, T (corresponding author), Imperial Coll, Ctr Processable Elect, London W12 0BZ, England.$  tian.du@fau.de; j.briscoe@qmul.ac.ukD  Persson, Kristin Aslaug/ABE-6343-2020; McLachlan, Martyn/J-6679-2012H  Su, Zhenhuang/0000-0003-0026-2601; McLachlan, Martyn/0000-0003-3136-1661¬≠ EPSRC Plastic Electronics CDT [EP/L016702/1]; QMUL-EPSRC Impact Accelerator Account; Stephen and Anna Hui Scholarship (Imperial College London); Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Scienc<    es and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [NRF-2017K1A1A2013153]Y EPSRC Plastic Electronics CDT(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); QMUL-EPSRC Impact Accelerator Account; Stephen and Anna Hui Scholarship (Imperial College London); Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)¬≤ The authors would like to thank the EPSRC Plastic Electronics CDT (EP/L016702/1) for financial support and provision of equipment resource.

However, its application is hindered by the typically random defect distribution and complex mesoscopic environment. Here, employing cathodoluminescence, we demonstrate on-demand activation and control of colour centre emission at the twisted interface of two hexagonal boron nitride flakes. Further, we show that colour centre emission brightness can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude by tuning the twist angle. Additionally, by applying an external voltage, nearly 100% brightness modulation is achieved. Our ab initio GW and GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations suggest that the emission is correlated to nitrogen vacancies and that a twist-induced moire potential facilitates electron-hole recombination. This mechanism is further exploited to draw nanoscale colour centre patterns using electron beams. Colour centre emission from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) holds promise for quantum technologies but activation and tuning are challenging. Here, the authors show twist-angle emission brightness tuning and external voltage brightness modulation at the twisted interface of hBN flakes.z [Su, Cong; Zhang, Fang; Kahn, Salman; Shevitski, Brian;

Here we show how such polymorphic flexibility can be used to achieve topological states at highly ordered phase boundaries in a new quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), 1T'-WSe2. We observe edge states at the crystallographically aligned interface between a quantum spin Hall insulating domain of 1T'-WSe2 and a semiconducting domain of 1H-WSe2 in contiguous single layers. The QSHI nature of single-layer 1T'-WSe2 is verified using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to determine band inversion around a 120 meV energy gap, as well as scanning tunneling spectroscopy to directly image edge-state formation. Using this edge-state geometry we confirm the predicted penetration depth of one-dimensional interface states into the two-dimensional bulk of a QSHI for a well-specified crystallographic direction. These interfaces create opportunities for testing predictions of the microscopic behavior of topologically protected boundary states.¬ß [Ugeda, Miguel M.] DIPC, Manuel Lardizabal 4, San Sebastian 20018, Spain;

Notably, despite rapid progress in chiral magnetic research, one fundamental issue that remains unclear is how the chirality of chiral magnetic domains change as a magnetic field deforms the spin texture. Using spin-polarized low energy electron microscopy, the evolution of Fe/Ni chiral magnetic stripe domains are investigated in single-crystalline Fe/Ni/Cu/Co/Cu(001) multilayers in which the interlayer magnetic coupling between the Co and Fe/Ni films serves as an in-plane magnetic field. Contrary to theoretical works, it is found that the chirality of the Neel walls results in a parallel alignment of the magnetic stripes with the in-plane magnetic field direction. The transformation of chiral Neel walls into achiral Bloch walls can be precisely controlled by tuning the Cu spacer layer thickness. In addition, the domain wall exhibits a spontaneous asymmetry within the in-plane magnetic field, leading to an unbalanced chirality between the left-handed and right-handed Bloch walls. These new results foster a better understanding of the chiral domain properties within a magnetic field.Z [Li, Qian] Univ Sci & Technol China, Natl Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Hefei 230029, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Li, Qian; Yang, Mengmeng; Wang, Tianye; Qiu, Ziqiang] Anhui Univ, Inst Phys Sci & Informat Technol, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Yang, Mengmeng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Gong; Schmid, Andreas K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, NCEM, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yoon, Han Gyu; Won, Changyeon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Phys, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Kwon, Hee Young] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Spintron, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Hwang, Chanyong] Korea Res Inst Stand & Sci, Daejeon 305340, South Korea; [Zhang, Xixiang] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Phys Sci & Engn Div PSE, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Wu, Yizheng] Fudan Univ, State Key Lab Surface Phys, Dept Phys, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China¬∑ Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Anhui University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Kyung Hee University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea Research Institute of Standards & Science (KRISS); King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Fudan University√ñ  Yang, MM; Qiu, ZQ (corresponding author), Anhui Univ, Inst Phys Sci & Informat Technol, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Yang, MM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.&  mmyangphy@ahu.edu.cn; qiu@berkeley.edu√ç U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05CH11231, KCWF16]; Users with Excellence Program of Hefei Science Center CAS [2021HSC-UE003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11734006, 11974079, 12174364, 12104003]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [2108085QA20]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [wk2310000104]; Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Surface Physics of Fudan University [KF2020_06, KF2021_05]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NSF [DMR-1610060]; UC Office of the President Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives [MRP-17-454963]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government [NRF-2018R1D1A1B07047114]; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project [2019SHZDZX01]; Future Materials Discovery Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea [2015M3D1A1070467]; Science Research Center Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea [2015R1A5A1009962]; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)} U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Users with Excellence Program of Hefei Science Center CAS; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(<    Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Surface Physics of Fudan University; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UC Office of the President Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of Korea); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project; Future Materials Discovery Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Science Research Center Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology)C The project is primarily supported by U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 (van der Waals heterostructures program, KCWF16).

However, there have been limited studies on lithium stripping compared to lithium plating. Here we report the lithium stripping mechanisms revealed through in-situ electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We directly observe and compare the stripping behavior of the in-situ grown lithium dendrites and lithium nanograins covered by a lithium fluoride-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). We find the sporadic lithium stripping behavior and three important modes that can describe the stripping of individual lithium deposits, regardless of their morphology: (i) symmetric stripping, (ii) surface-preferred asymmetric stripping, and (iii) interface-preferred asymmetric stripping. In addition, SEI chemical mapping with high spatial resolution shows a remarkable SEI loss at the end of the lithium metal stripping, which illustrates the importance of SEI protection in the subsequent cycles.√§ [Lee, Seung-Yong; Shangguan, Junyi; Betzler, Sophia; Zheng, Haimei] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lee, Seung-Yong] Hanyang Univ, Div Mat Sci & Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Seung-Yong] Hanyang Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Shangguan, Junyi; Zheng, Haimei] Univ Calif, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA USA; [Harris, Stephen J.; Doeff, Marca M.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA USA United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Hanyang University; Hanyang University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) , Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) , Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [NRF-2021R1F1A1051412, NRF- 2022R1C1C1010157]; Hanyang University [HY-202100000000761]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency, Vehicle Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy under the Advanced Battery Materials Research Program√£ U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) , Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) , Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Hanyang University; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency, Vehicle Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy under the Advanced Battery Materials Research Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))√∏ This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) , Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) , Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Contract No. DE-AC02-05-CH11231 within the KC22ZH program.

Our calculations indicate that valley-spin resolved isolated superlattice flat bands that carry a finite Chern number C = 3 proportional to the layer number can appear near charge neutrality for appropriate perpendicular electric fields and twist angles. When the degeneracy of the bands is lifted by Coulomb interactions, these topological bands can lead to anomalous quantum Hall phases that embody orbital and spin magnetism. Narrow bandwidths of similar to 10 meV achievable for a continuous range of twist angles theta less than or similar to 0.6 degrees with moderate interlayer potential differences of similar to 50 meV make the TLG-BN systems a promising platform for the study of electric-field tunable Coulomb-interaction-driven spontaneous Hall phases.√ï [Chittari, Bheema Lingam; Jung, Jeil] Univ Seoul, Dept Phys, Seoul 02504, South Korea; [Chittari, Bheema Lingam; Chen, Guorui; Wang, Feng; Jung, Jeil] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA; [Zhang, Yuanbo] Fudan Univ, State Key Lab Surface Phys, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuanbo] Fudan Univ, Dept Phys, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuanbo] Fudan Univ, Inst Nanoelect Devices & Quantum Comp, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China¬ç  University of Seoul; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Fudan University; Fudan University; Fudan University¬®  Jung, J (corresponding author), Univ Seoul, Dept Phys, Seoul 02504, South Korea.;Jung, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA.  jeiljung@uos.ac.kr<  wang, Feng/I-5727-2015; CHITTARI, BHEEMALINGAM/AAI-4035-2020J  wang, Feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; CHITTARI, BHEEMALINGAM/0000-0002-5868-2775{ National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2018R1A6A1A06024977]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Key Research Program of China [2016YFA0300703, 2018YFA0305600]; NSF of China [U1732274, 11527805, 11425415, 11421404]; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission [18JC1410300]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB30000000]; Samsung Science and Technology Foundation [SSTF-BA1802-06];  [NRF-2016R1A2B4010105];  [NRF-2017R1D1A1B03035932]o National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Key Research Program of China; NSF of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Samsung Science and Technology Foundation(Samsung); ; > We thank A.

In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked spin-valley diffusion current in tungsten disulfide (WS2)-tungsten diselenide (WSe2) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the propagation of valley current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field-free generation of a locked spin-valley current in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in spin and valley devices.√á [Jin, Chenhao; Kim, Jonghwan; Utama, M.

Electrical stimuli can influence quasiparticle interactions and the free-energy landscape(5,6), making it possible to dynamically modify the stacking order and reveal hidden structures that host different quantum properties. Here, we demonstrate electrically driven stacking transitions that can be applied to design non-volatile memory based on Berry curvature in few-layer WTe2. The interplay of out-of-plane electric fields and electrostatic doping controls in-plane interlayer sliding and creates multiple polar and centrosymmetric stacking orders. In situ nonlinear Hall transport reveals that such stacking rearrangements result in a layer-parity-selective Berry curvature memory in momentum space, where the sign reversal of the Berry curvature and its dipole only occurs in odd-layer crystals. Our findings open an avenue towards exploring coupling between topology, electron correlations and ferroelectricity in hidden stacking orders and demonstrate a new low-energy-cost, electrically controlled topological memory in the atomically thin limit. A memory device is proposed that uses a dynamical modification of the stacking order of few-layer WTe(2)to encode information. The change in stacking modifies both the Berry curvature and the Hall transport, allowing two states to be distinguished.a [Xiao, Jun; Muscher, Philipp; Devereaux, Thomas P.; Lindenberg, Aaron M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xiao, Jun; Pemmaraju, C.

This manuscript introduces matminer, an open-source, Python-based software platform to facilitate data-driven methods of analyzing and predicting materials properties. Matminer provides modules for retrieving large data sets from external databases such as the Materials Project, Citrination, Materials Data Facility, and Materials Platform for Data Science. It also provides implementations for an extensive library of feature extraction routines developed by the materials community, with 47 featurization classes that can generate thousands of individual descriptors and combine them into mathematical functions. Finally, matminer provides a visualization module for producing interactive, shareable plots. These functions are designed in a way that integrates closely with machine learning and data analysis packages already developed and in use by the Python data science community. We explain the structure and logic of matminer, provide a description of its various modules, and showcase several examples of how matminer can be used to collect data, reproduce data mining studies reported in the literature, and test new methodologies. [Ward, Logan; Chard, Kyle; Foster, Ian] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Ward, Logan; Chard, Kyle; Foster, Ian] Argonne Natl Lab, Data Sci & Learning Div, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Dunn, Alexander; Faghaninia, Alireza; Zimmermann, Nils E.

For example, mini-Dirac points, tunable Mott insulator states and the Hofstadter butterfly pattern can emerge in different types of graphen<    e/boron nitride moire superlattices, whereas correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been reported in twisted bilayer graphene moire superlattices(1-12). In addition to their pronounced effects on single-particle states, moire superlattices have recently been predicted to host excited states such as moire exciton bands(13-15). Here we report the observation of moire superlattice exciton states in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe2/WS2) heterostructures in which the layers are closely aligned. These moire exciton states manifest as multiple emergent peaks around the original WSe2 A exciton resonance in the absorption spectra, and they exhibit gate dependences that are distinct from that of the A exciton in WSe2 monolayers and in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures with large twist angles. These phenomena can be described by a theoretical model in which the periodic moire potential is much stronger than the exciton kinetic energy and generates multiple flat exciton minibands. The moire exciton bands provide an attractive platform from which to explore and control excited states of matter, such as topological excitons and a correlated exciton Hubbard model, in transitionmetal dichalcogenides.¬Ø [Jin, Chenhao; Regan, Emma C.; Yan, Aiming; Utama, M.

Development of these technologies requires photoelectrode materials that are both photocatalytically active and operationally stable in harsh oxidative and/or reductive electrochemical environments. Such photocatalysts can be discovered based on co-design principles, wherein design for stability is based on the propensity for the photocatalyst to self-passivate under operating conditions and design for photoactivity is based on the ability to integrate the photocatalyst with established semiconductor substrates. Here, we report on the synthesis and characterization of zinc titanium nitride (ZnTiN2) that follows these design rules by having a wurtzite-derived crystal structure and showing self-passivating surface oxides created by electrochemical polarization. The sputtered ZnTiN2 thin films have optical absorption onsets below 2 eV and n-type electrical conduction of 3 S/cm. The band gap of this material is reduced from the 3.36 eV theoretical value by cation-site disorder, and the impact of cation antisites on the band structure of ZnTiN2 is explored using density functional theory. Under electrochemical polarization, the ZnTiN2 surfaces have TiO2- or ZnO-like character, consistent with Materials Project Pourbaix calculations predicting the formation of stable solid phases under near-neutral pH. These results show that ZnTiN2 is a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical liquid fuel generation and demonstrate a new materials design approach to other photoelectrodes with self-passivating native operational surface chemistry.5 [Ke, Sijia] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat & Chem Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ke, Sijia; Persson, Kristin A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Greenaway, Ann L.; Culman, Theodore; Talley, Kevin R.; Mangum, John S.; Heinselman, Karen N.; Smaha, Rebecca W.; Gish, Melissa K.; Miller, Elisa M.; Bauers, Sage R.; Tamboli, Adele C.; Zakutayev, Andriy] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Mat Chem & Computat Sci Directorate, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Kingsbury, Ryan S.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Stor<    age & Distributed Resources Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gregoire, John M.] CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Kavli Energy Nanosci Inst Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA¬¢ United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; California Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California Berkeley‚Ä∞  Greenaway, AL; Zakutayev, A (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Mat Chem & Computat Sci Directorate, Golden, CO 80401 USA.1  Ann.Greenaway@nrel.gov; Andriy.Zakutayev@nrel.gov  Bauers, Sage/AAE-3078-2019¬Æ  Bauers, Sage/0000-0002-6505-5016; Miller, Elisa/0000-0002-7648-5433; Smaha, Rebecca/0000-0002-8349-2615; Gish, Melissa/0000-0002-9886-3626; Greenaway, Ann/0000-0001-6681-9965√ó U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0021266]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0021266]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, DE-AC36-08GO28308]; DOE Office of Science, Office of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists under the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship program; Director's Fellowship within NREL's Laboratory Directed Research and Development program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC36-08GO28308]d U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Office of Science, Office of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists under the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Director's Fellowship within NREL's Laboratory Directed Research and Development program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))j This work was performed in part at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, operated by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

Q.B  Spin canting of Ni/CoO/Fe films grown on curved MgO(001) substrate Using element-resolved x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) measurements, we determined the spin orientations of Ni, CoO and Fe films in Ni/CoO/Fe films grown on a curved MgO(001) substrate. We find that the vicinal surface of MgO(001) substrate results in a spin canting towards out-of-plane direction in the Ni and CoO films as a result of the interfacial coupling. The Ni spin canting angle increases monotonically with the vicinal angle in the studied range of 0-17 degrees and the CoO spin canting angle increases more rapidly towards saturation only at a few degrees of the vicinal angle. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy induced in the Ni layer by the Ni/CoO interfacial coupling is quantitatively determined and is shown to increase monotonically with the vicinal angle. Our result provides a new pathway for tailoring the spin orientation by modifying the substrate surface symmetry in combining with the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interfacial interaction in thin-film based spintronic devices.√∞ [Yang, M.] Anhui Univ, Inst Phys Sci & Informat Technol, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Li, Q.] Univ Sci & Technol China, Natl Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Hefei 230029, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Yang, M.; Li, Q.; Wang, T.

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to breaking the in-plane symmetry of graphene with electric fields on AB-stacked bilayers(1,2) or stacked van der Waals heterostructures(3,4). In contrast, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers are semiconductors with intrinsic in-plane asymmetry, leading to direct electronic bandgaps, distinctive optical properties and great potential in optoelectronics(5,6). Apart from their in-plane inversion asymmetry, an additional degree of freedom allowing spin manipulation can be induced by breaking the out-of-plane mirror symmetry with external electric fields(7,8) or, as theoretically proposed, with an asymmetric out-of-plane structural configuration(9). Here, we report a synthetic strategy to grow Janus monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides breaking the out-of-plane structural symmetry. In particular, based on a MoS2 monolayer, we fully replace the top-layer S with Se atoms. We confirm the Janus structure of MoSSe directly by means of scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and prove the existence of vertical dipoles by second harmonic generation and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements.| [Lu, Ang-Yu;

In the special issue to celebrate the 40th anniversary of CPC, published in 2009, a detailed account of ABINIT was included [Gonze et al. (2009)], and has been amply cited. The present article comes as a follow-up to this 2009 publication. It includes an analysis of the impact that ABINIT has had, through for example the bibliometric indicators of the 2009 publication. Links with several other computational materials science projects are described. This article also covers the new capabilities of Mimi - that - have-been-implemented during_the_last three years, complementing a recent update of the 2009 article published in 2016. Physical and technical developments inside the abinit application are covered, as well as developments provided with the ABINIT package, Such as the MULTIBINIT and A-TDEP projects, and related ABImirorganization developments such as ABIPY. The new developments are described with relevant references, input variables, tests, and tutorials.

The present 8.10.3 version is now the up-to-date stable version of abinit, and supercedes the 7.10.5 version. Reasons for the new version: New developments Summary of revisions: Many new capabilities of the main abinit application, related to density-functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory, GW, the Bethe-Salpeter equation, dynamical mean-field theory, etc. New applications in the package: multibinit (second-principles calculations) and tdep (temperature-dependent properties) Nature of problem: Computing accurately material and nanostructure properties: electronic structure, bond lengths, bond angles, primitive cell, cohesive energy, dielectric properties, vibrational properties, elastic properties, optical properties, magnetic properties, non-linear couplings, electronic and vibrational lifetimes, etc. For large-scale systems, second-principles calculations, building upon the first-principles results, are also possible. Solution method: Software application based on density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, pseudopotentials, with plane waves or wavelets as basis functions. Different real-time algorithms are implemented for second-principles calculations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.¬Ø

Q.I  Current switching of the antiferromagnetic Neel vector in Pd/CoO/MgO(001)  MAGNETIC MULTILAYER; EXCITATION  Recently, the electrical switching of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order has been intensively investigated because of its application potential in data storage technology. Herein, we report the current switching of the AFM Neel vector in epitaxial Pd/CoO films as a function of temperature. Using combined measurements of Hall resistance (HR) and x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) below and above the AFM Neel temperature, we unambiguously identified both magnetic and nonmagnetic contributions to the current-induced HR change. Through magnetic field-induced HR measurements, we quantitatively determined the percentage of current -induced CoO spin switching. Further, we showed that the thermal effect dominated the CoO magnetic switching more in samples with a thinner Pd layer and that samples with a thicker CoO layer required higher thermal activation for current-induced magnetic switching. These results provide a clear and comprehensive picture of current-induced AFM spin switching across the AFM Neel temperature.¬† [Yang, M.] Anhui Univ, Inst Phys Sci & Informat Technol, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Li, Q.; Li, Z.; Yan, W.
