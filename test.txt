      <td>The morphological changes of phosphonate polypeptoid electrolyte membranes, poly-N-(2-ethyl)hexylglycine-block-poly-N-phosphonomethylglycine (pNeh(m)-b-pNpm(n)), in hydrated and dry states were characterized by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET). The analysis of 3D tomograms revealed that the pNeh(9)-b-pNpm(9) thin films absorbed a large amount of water, resulting in the formation of membranes that were nearly flat and giant multicompartment vesicles dispersed in the water phase. A simple lamellar phase appeared when the films were dried. In contrast, pNeh(18)-b-pNpm(18) thin films absorbed little water and formed small highly curved unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles. Water was located mainly outside the closely-packed vesicles. When water was removed by drying, the walls of adjacent vesicles collapsed to form honeycomb-like capsules. The changes in domain size reflected changes in chain conformations. The pNpm(9) blocks were saturated by water and fully extended, while pNpm(18) blocks were neither saturated by water nor fully extended. In addition, the thicknesses of hydrophobic blocks in the hydrated films of both pNeh(9)-b-pNpm(9) and pNeh(18)-b-pNpm(18) were smaller than those in the dry films, reflecting an increase of the average distance between the neighboring junctions of polypeptoid molecules.</td>

      <td>Electron microscopy has played an important role in polymer characterization. Traditionally, electron diffraction is used to study crystalline polymers while transmission electron microscopy is used to study microphase separation in stained block copolymers and other multiphase systems. We describe developments that eliminate the barrier between these two approaches-it is now possible to image polymer crystals with atomic resolution. The focus of this Review is on high-resolution imaging (30 angstrom and smaller) of unstained polymers. Recent advances in hardware allow for capturing numerous (as many as 10(5)) low-dose images from an unperturbed specimen; beam damage is a significant barrier to high-resolution electron microscopy of polymers. Machine-learning-based software is then used to sort and average the images to retrieve pristine structural information from a collection of noisy images. Acknowledging the heterogeneity in polymer samples prior to averaging is essential. Molecular conformations in a wide range of amphiphilic block copolymers, polymerized ionic liquids, and conjugated polymers can be gleaned from two-dimensional projections (2D), three-dimensional (3D) tomograms, and fourdimensional (4D) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) data sets where 2D diffraction patterns are taken as a function of position. Some methods such as phase contrast STEM have been used to image closely related materials such as metal-organic frameworks but not polymers. With improvements in hardware and software, such methods may soon be applied to polymers. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the strategies toward the high-resolution imaging of radiation sensitive polymer materials at different length scales.</td>

      <td>We introduce a novel composite holey gold support that prevents cryo-crinkling and reduces beam-induced motion of soft specimens, building on the previously introduced all-gold support. The composite holey gold support for high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy of soft crystalline membranes was fabricated in two steps. In the first step, a holey gold film was transferred on top of a molybdenum grid. In the second step, a continuous thin carbon film was transferred onto the holey gold film. This support (Au/Mo grid) was used to image crystalline synthetic polymer membranes. The low thermal expansion of Mo is not only expected to avoid cryo-crinkling of the membrane when the grids are cooled to cryogenic temperatures, but it may also act to reduce whatever crinkling existed even before cooling. The Au/Mo grid exhibits excellent performance with specimens tilted to 45 degrees. This is demonstrated by quantifying beam-induced motion and differences in local defocus values. In addition, images of specimens on the Au/Mo grids that are tilted at 45 degrees show high-resolution information of the crystalline membranes that, after lattice-unbending, extends beyond 1.5 angstrom in the direction perpendicular to the tilt axis.</td>

      <td>The universal pairing of complementary nucleobases in DNA found in all life forms has inspired extensive studies on selective molecular recognition between information-rich sequence-defined polymer chains. Here we utilized the shape complementarity of sequence-defined peptoids to achieve selective assembly between peptoid chains. Three sets of self-complementary peptoids bearing different overall molecular shapes, determined by the monomer sequence (trapezoid, comb and zig-zag), were synthesized and systematically studied by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. All these peptoids crystallized in bulk into a nearly identical rectangular crystal lattice as evidenced by their similar melting temperatures and X-ray diffraction peaks. In aqueous solution, they all self-assembled into crystalline monolayer nanosheets with a known rectangular crystal lattice motif, regardless of their varied molecular shapes. These results suggest that complementary molecular shape could be a potential design element for the construction of more sophisticated, hierarchically-ordered peptoid nanomaterials that approach the structural and functional complexity found in biomacromolecular nanostructure.</td>

      <td>Cryogenic electron microscopy at atomic length scales was used to study the structure of self-assembled crystalline nanosheets obtained from a series of polypeptoids with the same chain architecture but with different end groups. While long-range order is enhanced by slowing down the self-assembly process, the dominant crystalline motif was found to be a sensitive function of both processing details and end group chemistry. In some cases, adjacent rows of polypeptoid molecules adopt anti-parallel V-shaped side chain conformations. In other cases, adjacent rows of polypeptoid molecules adopt parallel V-shaped side chain conformations. Interestingly, the unit cell is rectangular in both cases with dimensions a = 4.5 angstrom and c = 50 angstrom. In all cases, long-range order, quantified by the average number of concatenated unit cells of the same type, is more prevalent along the a direction.</td>

      <td>In this work, we examine the swelling of nanostructured block copolymer electrolytes immersed in liquid water. A series of sulfonated polystyrene-b-polyethylene-b-polystyrene (S-SES) membranes having the same nominal chemical composition but two different morphologies are prepared by systematic changes in processing. We start with a membrane comprising a mixture of homopolymer polystyrene (hPS) and a polystyrene-b-polyethylene-b-polystyrene (SES) copolymer. hPS is subsequently selectively removed from the membrane and the polystyrene domains are sulfonated to give S-SES membranes. The morphology of the membranes is controlled by controlling phi(v), the volume fraction of hPS in the blended membrane. The morphology of the membranes was studied by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM), and cryogenic electron tomography. The overall domain swelling measured by SAXS decreases slightly at phi(v) = 0.29; a crossover from lamellar to bicontinuous morphology is obtained at the same value of phi(v). The bicontinuous morphologies absorb more water than the lamellar morphologies. By contrast, the nanodomain swelling of the bicontinuous membrane (120%) is slightly less than that of the lamellar membrane (150%). Quantitative analysis of the STEM images and electron tomography was used to determine the swelling on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains due to exposure to water. The hydrophilic sulfonated polystyrene-rich domain spacing increases while the hydrophobic polyethylene domain spacing decreases when the membranes are hydrated. The extent of increase and decrease is not a strong function of phi(v). Published by AIP Publishing.</td>

      <td>Vesicle formation in a series of amphiphilic sequence-defined polypeptoid block co-polymers comprising a phosphonated hydrophilic block and an amorphous hydrophobic block, poly-N- (2- ethyl)hexylglycine-block-poly-N-phosphonomethylglycine (pNeh-b-pNpm), is studied. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic block ratio was varied keeping the total chain length of the co-polymers constant. A new approach for characterizing the vesicle membrane morphology based on low-dose cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is described. The individual low-dose micrographs cannot be interpreted directly due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Sorting and averaging techniques, developed in the context of protein structure determination, were thus applied to vesicle micrographs. Molecular dynamic simulations of the vesicles were used to establish the relationship between membrane morphology and averaged cryo-EM images. This approach enables resolution of the local thickness of the hydrophobic membrane core at the 1 nm length scale. The thickness of the hydrophobic core of the pNeh-b-pNpm membranes increases linearly with the length of the hydrophobic block.</td>

      <td>Most of the work on Lithium-sulfur (LiS) batteries use liquid electrolytes that have limited stability when coupled with Li metal anodes. We have studied LiS batteries with a solid block copolymer electrolyte which exhibits improved stability against Li anodes. The electrolyte comprises a polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (SEO) copolymer doped with a Li salt. Hollow carbon nanospheres impregnated with sulfur were used to build a composite cathode. Two types of sulfur-impregnated functionalized carbon nanospheres were used: one with carboxylic acid groups and the other with short lithium poly(4-styrenesulfonyl (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (PSTFSI-Li) chains. Cells with Li2S8 dissolved in the SEO based electrolyte served as the baseline. After cycling, the reason for capacity fade was determined by imaging the batteries using synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography. It is generally assumed that LiS cells fail due to dissolution of polysulfide into the liquid electrolyte, i.e., the main problems related to the cathode. In our all-solid cells, failure was primarily due to delamination of the Li foil from the polymer electrolyte layer. Delamination is also observed at the sulfur cathode. It is likely that the large changes in volume of the active materials during cycling induce delamination in all-solid LiS cells. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society (ECS).

      <td>The advent of higher resolution and throughput photoemission spectroscopy experiments has made angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) a critical tool for the study of quantum materials. The simultaneous development of novel ARPES techniques, including nano/mu-ARPES, spin-resolved ARPES, and pump-probe ARPES mirrors the expansion in scanning modes for scanning tunneling microscopy, which made scanning probe methods the gold standard for driving insights into surface physics. In this paper, we introduce PyARPES, an open source and modular data analysis framework for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopies. We highlight PyARPES' current capabilities for the analysis of the large photoemission datasets created by nano-ARPES and pump-probe ARPES experiments, show how PyARPES fulfills current data analysis needs for ARPES analysis, and discuss prospects for the future of analysis techniques enabled by PyARPES.

      <td>Rational design of supramolecular nanomaterials fundamentally depends upon an atomic-level understanding of their structure and how it responds to chemical modifications. Here we studied a series of crystalline diblock copolypeptoids by a combination of sequence-controlled synthesis, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulation. This family of amphiphilic polypeptoids formed free-floating 2-dimensional monolayer nanosheets, in which individual polymer chains and their relative orientations could be directly observed. Furthermore, bromine atom side-chain substituents in nanosheets were directly visualized by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, revealing atomic details in position space inaccessible by conventional scattering techniques. While the polypeptoid backbone conformation was conserved across the set of molecules, the nanosheets exhibited different lattice packing geometries dependent on the aromatic side chain para substitutions. Peptoids are inherently achiral, yet we showed that sequences containing an asymmetric aromatic substitution pattern pack with alternating rows adopting opposite backbone chiralities. These atomic-level insights into peptoid nanosheet crystal structure provide guidance for the future design of bioinspired nanomaterials with more precisely controlled structures and properties.</td>

      <td>Properties of soft crystalline materials such as synthetic polymers are governed by locations of constituent atoms. Determining atomic-scale structures in these materials is difficult because they degrade rapidly when studied by electron microscopy, and techniques such as X-ray scattering average over volumes much larger than coherent blocks of the unit cells. We obtained cryo-electron microscopy images of self-assembled nanosheets of a peptoid polymer, made by solid-phase synthesis, in which we see a variety of crystalline motifs. A combination of crystallographic and single-particle methods, developed for cryo-electron microscopy of biological macromolecules, was used to obtain high-resolution images of the crystals. Individual crystals contain grains that are mirror images of each other with concomitant grain boundaries. We have used molecular dynamic simulations to build an atomic model of the crystal structure to facilitate the interpretation of electron micrographs. Direct visualization of crystalline grains and grain boundaries on atomic length scales represents a new level of information for the polymer field.</td>

      <td>Polypeptoid homopolymers and block copolymers undergo thermal transitions in the solid state that can be detected by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), but so far there is neither consensus on the underpinnings of the observed thermal transitions nor consensus on the expected number of transitions. We synthesized a series of polypeptoid diblock copolymers containing hydrophobic alkyl side chains and hydrophilic ethylene oxide side chains, systematically varying side-chain length (S), backbone main-chain length (N), block copolymer composition (n/m), and N-terminal group, and studied their thermal transitions by a combination of X-ray scattering and DSC. The thermal transitions are largely unaffected by S, N, and n/m but strongly affected by the N-terminal group. Block copolymers with an acetylated N-terminus exhibit two thermal transitions. The low temperature thermal transition is due to a transition from a crystalline phase to a sanidic liquid crystalline mesophase. The molecules adopt planar, boardlike conformations and are arranged in a rectangular crystal lattice with extended backbones that run parallel to each other. The side chains extend on either side and are located within the plane of the backbone. The liquid crystalline phase is characterized by conformational disorder in dimensions normal to the molecular plane. The high temperature thermal transition is due to melting of the liquid crystalline phase to give an isotropic phase. Block copolymers with a free N-terminus (non-acetylated) exhibit only one thermal transition and similar out-of-plane conformational disorder. This disorder appears to be due to a difference in the pendant side chain display angle of the terminal nitrogen atom.</td>

      <td>A monolayer 2D capping layer with high Young's modulus is shown to be able to effectively suppress the dewetting of underlying thin films of small organic semiconductor molecule, polymer, and polycrystalline metal, respectively. To verify the universality of this capping layer approach, the dewetting experiments are performed for single-layer graphene transferred onto polystyrene (PS), semiconducting thienoazacoronene (EH-TAC), gold, and also MoS2 on PS. Thermodynamic modeling indicates that the exceptionally high Young's modulus and surface conformity of 2D capping layers such as graphene and MoS2 substantially suppress surface fluctuations and thus dewetting. As long as the uncovered area is smaller than the fluctuation wavelength of the thin film in a dewetting process via spinodal decomposition, the dewetting should be suppressed. The 2D monolayer-capping approach opens up exciting new possibilities to enhance the thermal stability and expands the processing parameters for thin film materials without significantly altering their physical properties.</td>

      <td>Crystalline nanosheets formed by amphiphilic block copolypeptoids with halogenated phenyl side chains were imaged at the atomic-scale using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). In general, the polypeptoid molecules adopt Vshaped configurations in the crystalline state, and adjacent molecules can pack with one another in either parallel or antiparallel arrangements, depending on the chemical composition. The halogen bond, which can have characteristic energies ranging from 1 to 5 kcal/mol, is commensurate with the parallel configuration. However, cryo-TEM images show that chains in the halogenated crystals were in the antiparallel configuration. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that positively charged a-holes, which are characteristic of halogen atoms covalently bonded to carbon atoms, play an important role in determining crystal geometry. Parallel and antiparallel configurations exhibited similar stability in simulations when standard force fields that only account for the electronegativity of halogen atoms were used. However, including the alpha-hole in the simulations resulted in a destabilization of the parallel configuration. This combination of imaging and simulation, which has played an important role in structural biology, has the potential to improve our understanding of factors that govern noncovalent interactions in synthetic materials.</td>

      <td>Spin-orbit (SO) coupling combined with space inversion symmetry breaking is at the origin of the lifting of the spin degeneracy in the band structure of many materials. The momentum-dependent energy splitting and the degree of spin polarization are indicative of the strength and symmetry of the SO interaction, and enter in the figure of merit of essentially all conceptual designs aiming to control the electron spin degree of freedom in solids. Here we briefly review the role played by spin- and-angle-resolved photoemission (spin ARPES or SARPES) in revealing the spin polarization specifically in the topological states of 3-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs), and we discuss how the progress in the technique can assist the rise of several active fields like spintronics, spin-orbitronics or the generation of spin-polarized beams.

      <td>One of the most puzzling features of high-temperature cuprate superconductors is the pseudogap state, which appears above the temperature at which superconductivity is destroyed. There remain fundamental questions regarding its nature and its relation to superconductivity. But to address these questions, we must first determine whether the pseudogap and superconducting states share a common property: particle-hole symmetry. We introduce a new technique to test particle-hole symmetry by using laser pulses tomanipulate and measure the chemical potential on picosecond time scales. The results strongly suggest that the asymmetry in the density of states is inverted in the pseudogap state, implying a particle-hole asymmetric gap. Independent of interpretation, these results can test theoretical predictions of the density of states in cuprates.</td>

The polymer exhibits a lamellar morphology both in the neat state and in the presence of salt. However, the average grain size increases substantially when the electrolyte is heated above 113 degrees C. The grain structure of this sample changes reversibly with temperature, that is, smaller grains reappear when the electrolyte is cooled below 113 degrees C. While annealing block copolymers at high temperatures often leads to an increase in the grain size, this change is generally irreversible. The reason for the reversible change in the grain structure of the POSS-PEO-POSS/LiTFSI electrolyte is discussed. The ionic conductivity of the electrolyte also exhibits reversible changes in this temperature window. Knowledge of the grain structure is crucial for understanding ion transport in nanostructured electrolytes.</td>

      <td>We study how time- and angle-resolved photoemission (tr-ARPES) reveals the dynamics of BCS-type, s-wave superconducting systems with time-varying order parameters. Approximate methods are discussed, based on previous approaches to either optical conductivity or quantum dot transport, to enable computationally efficient prediction of photoemission spectra. One use of such predictions is to enable extraction of the underlying order parameter dynamics from experimental data, which is topical given the rapidly growing use of tr-ARPES in studying unconventional superconductivity. The methods considered model the two-time lesser Green's functions with an approximated lesser self-energy that describes relaxation by coupling of the system to two types of baths. The approach primarily used here also takes into consideration the relaxation of the excited states into equilibrium by explicitly including the level-broadening of the retarded and advanced Green's functions. We present equilibrium and nonequilibrium calculations of tr-ARPES spectrum from our model and discuss the signatures of different types of superconducting dynamics.</td>

      <td>Be it for essential everyday applications such as bright light-emitting devices or to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation, materials in which high densities of excitons recombine radiatively are crucially important. However, in all excitonic materials, exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) becomes the dominant loss mechanism at high densities. Typically, a macroscopic parameter named EEA coefficient (C-EEA) is used to compare EEA rates between materials at the same density; higher C-EEA implies higher EEA rate. Here, we find that the reported values of C-EEA for 140 different materials is inversely related to the single-exciton lifetime. Since during EEA one exciton must relax to ground state, C-EEA is proportional to the single-exciton recombination rate. This leads to the counterintuitive observation that the exciton density at which EEA starts to dominate is higher in a material with larger C-EEA. These results broaden our understanding of EEA across different material systems and provide a vantage point for future excitonic materials and devices.</td>

      <td>Strain engineering in transition metal dichalcogenides is an important means to manipulate these materials' electronic and optical properties. Recently, it has been shown that WSe2 monolayers grown on fused silica substrates using chemical vapor deposition can retain residual strain due to thermal expansion mismatch. Moreover, it was demonstrated that this strain can be released using a solvent-evaporation mediated decoupling method. A continuum theory to explain these observations is introduced and its predictions analyzed. The theory is used to establish that it is plausible that bonds much weaker than typical covalent bonds are sufficient to stabilize strains in the range of those experimentally observed. It is shown that the presence of the solvent modifies the equilibrium in-plane displacement of the film, while its lifting is negligible. Under the proper conditions, this displacement leads to an increase in the decoupling force, thereby initiating the strain relief process. The theory clarifies the role of the liquid surface tension in the relaxation process, and it identifies the relationships between droplet wetting behavior and initial strain state that will lead to solute-evaporation mediated decoupling.</td>

Here, a new tool called ChemEnv, which can identify coordination environments in a fast and robust manner, is presented. In contrast to previous tools, the assessment of the coordination environments is not biased by small distortions of the crystal structure. Its robust and fast implementation enables the analysis of large databases of structures. The code is available open source within the pymatgen package and the software can also be used through a web app available on http://crystaltoolkit.org through the Materials Project.</td>

      <td>Host-guest molecular recognition at the liquid-liquid interface endows the interface with unique properties, including stimuli-responsiveness and self-regulation, due to the dynamic and reversible nature of non-covalent interactions. Increasing research efforts have been put into the preparation of supramolecular interfacial systems such as films and microcapsules by integrating functional components (e.g., colloidal particles, polymers) at the interface, providing tremendous opportunities in the areas of encapsulation, delivery vehicles, and biphasic reaction systems. In this review, we summarize recent progress in supramolecular interfacial systems assembled by host-guest chemistry, and provide an overview of the fabrication process, functions, and promising applications of the resultant constructs.

      <td>Solid ferromagnetic materials are rigid in shape and cannot be reconfigured. Ferrofluids, although reconfigurable, are paramagnetic at room temperature and lose their magnetization when the applied magnetic field is removed. Here, we show a reversible paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transformation of ferrofluid droplets by the jamming of a monolayer of magnetic nanoparticles assembled at the water-oil interface. These ferromagnetic liquid droplets exhibit a finite coercivity and remanent magnetization. They can be easily reconfigured into different shapes while preserving the magnetic properties of solid ferromagnets with classic north-south dipole interactions. Their translational and rotational motions can be actuated remotely and precisely by an external magnetic field, inspiring studies on active matter, energy-dissipative assemblies, and programmable liquid constructs.</td>

      <td>The future of modern optoelectronics and spintronic devices relies on our ability to control the spin and charge degrees of freedom at ultrafast timescales. Rashba spin-split quantum well states, 2D states that develop at the surface of strong spin-orbit coupling materials, are ideal given the tunability of their energy and spin states. So far, however, most studies have only demonstrated such control in a static way. In this study, we demonstrate control of the spin and energy degrees of freedom of surface quantum well states on Bi2Se3 at picosecond timescales. By means of a focused laser pulse, we modulate the band-bending, producing picosecond time-varying electric fields at the material's surface, thereby reversibly modulating the quantum well spectrum and Rashba effect. Moreover, we uncover a dynamic quasi-Fermi level, dependent on the Lifshitz transition of the second quantum well band bottom. These results open a pathway for light-driven spintronic devices with ultrafast switching of electronic phases, and offer the interesting prospect to extend this ultrafast photo-gating technique to a broader host of 2D materials.</td>

      <td>Low power silicon based light source and detector are attractive for on-chip photonic circuits given their ease of process integration. However, conventional silicon light emitting diodes emit photons with energies near the band edge where the corresponding silicon photodetectors lack responsivity. On the other hand, previously reported hot carrier electroluminescent silicon devices utilizing a reverse biased diode require high operating voltages. Here, we investigate hot carrier electroluminescence in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors operating under transient voltage conditions. During each voltage transient, large energy band bending is created at the edge of the source contact, much larger than what is achievable at a steady state. As a result, electrons and holes are injected efficiently from a single source contact into the silicon channel at the corresponding voltage transient, where they subsequently undergo impact ionization and phonon-assisted interband recombination. Notably, we show low voltage operation down to 2.8 V by using a 20 nm thick high- kappa gate dielectric. We show further voltage scaling is possible by reducing the gate dielectric thickness, thus presenting a low voltage platform for silicon optoelectronic integrated circuits.

      <td>Because of the important role of electron-boson interactions in conventional superconductivity, it has long been asked whether any similar mechanism is at play in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Evidence for strong electron-boson coupling is observed in cuprates with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), in the form of a dispersion kink and peak-dip-hump structure. What is missing is evidence of a causal relation to superconductivity. Here we revisit the problem using the technique of time-resolved ARPES on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta. We focus on the peak-dip-hump structure, and show that laser pulses shift spectral weight into the dip as superconductivity is destroyed on picosecond time scales. We compare our results to simulations of Eliashberg theory in a superconductor with an Einstein boson, and find that the magnitude of the shift in spectral weight depends on the degree to which the bosonic mode contributes to superconductivity. Further study could address one of the longstanding mysteries of high-temperature superconductivity.</td>

The current release contains data derived from quantum mechanical calculations for more than 70,000 materials and millions of associated materials properties. The software infrastructure carries out thousands of calculations per week, enabling screening and predictions for both novel solids as well as molecular species with targeted properties. As the rapid growth of accessible computed materials properties continues, the next frontier is harnessing that information for automated learning and accelerated discovery.

      <td>Tellurium, as an elemental van der Waals semiconductor, has intriguing anisotropic physical properties owing to its inherent 1D crystal structure. To exploit the anisotropic and thickness-dependent behavior, it is important to realize orientated growth of ultrathin tellurium. Here, van der Waals epitaxial growth of Te on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is systematically investigated. Orientated growth of Te with a thickness down to 5 nm is realized on three-fold symmetric substrates (WSe2, WS2, MoSe2, and MoS2), where the atomic chains of Te are aligned with the armchair directions of substrates. 1D/2D moire superlattices are observed for the Te/WSe2 heterostructure. This method is extended to the growth of SeTe alloys, providing flexibility for band engineering. Finally, growth of textured Te film is demonstrated on the lower-symmetry surface of WTe2.</td>

      <td>Dominant recombination pathways in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) depend primarily on background carrier concentration, generation rate, and applied strain. Charged excitons formed in the presence of background carriers mainly recombine nonradiatively. Neutral excitons recombine completely radiatively at low generation rates, but experience nonradiative exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) at high generation rates. Strain can suppress EEA, resulting in near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) at all exciton densities. Although exciton diffusion is the primary channel of energy transport in excitonic materials and a critical optoelectronic design consideration, the combined effects of these factors on exciton diffusion are not clearly understood. In this work, we decouple the diffusion of neutral and charged excitons with chemical counterdoping and explore the effect of strain and generation rate on exciton diffusion. According to the standard semiconductor paradigm, a shorter carrier recombination lifetime should lead to a smaller diffusion length. Surprisingly, we find that increasing generation rate shortens the exciton lifetime but increases the diffusion length in unstrained monolayers of TMDCs. When we suppress EEA by strain, both lifetime and diffusion length become independent of generation rate. During EEA one exciton nonradiatively recombines and kinetically energizes another exciton, which then diffuses fast. Our results probe concentration-dependent diffusion of pure neutral excitons by counterdoping and elucidate how strain controls exciton transport and many-body interactions in TMDC monolayers.</td>

      <td>Pristine monocrystalline graphene is claimed to be the strongest material known with remarkable mechanical and electrical properties. However, graphene made with scalable fabrication techniques is polycrystalline and contains inherent nanoscale line and point defects-grain boundaries and grain-boundary triple junctions-that lead to significant statistical fluctuations in toughness and strength. These fluctuations become particularly pronounced for nanocrystalline graphene where the density of defects is high. Here we use large-scale simulation and continuum modelling to show that the statistical variation in toughness and strength can be understood with 'weakest-link' statistics. We develop the first statistical theory of toughness in polycrystalline graphene, and elucidate the nanoscale origins of the grain-size dependence of its strength and toughness. Our results should lead to more reliable graphene device design, and provide a framework to interpret experimental results in a broad class of two-dimensional materials.</td>

      <td>Black phosphorus (b-P) and more recently black phosphorus arsenic alloys (b-PAs) are candidate 2D materials for the detection of mid-wave and potentially long-wave infrared radiation. However, studies to date have utilized laser-based measurements to extract device performance and the responsivity of these detectors. As such, their performance under thermal radiation and spectral response has not been fully characterized. Here, we perform a systematic investigation of gated-photoconductors based on b-PAs alloys as a function of thickness over the composition range of 0-91% As. Infrared transmission and reflection measurements are performed to determine the bandgap of the various compositions. The spectrally resolved photoresponse for various compositions in this material system is investigated to confirm absorption measurements, and we find that the cutoff wavelength can be tuned from 3.9 to 4.6 mu m over the studied compositional range. In addition, we investigated the temperature-dependent photoresponse and performed calibrated responsivity measurements using blackbody flood illumination. Notably, we find that the specific detectivity (D*) can be optimized by adjusting the thickness of the b-P/b-PAs layer to maximize absorption and minimize dark current. We obtain a peak D* of 6 x 10(10) cm Hz(1/2) W-1 and 2.4 x 10(10) cm Hz(1/2) W-1 for pure b-P and b-PAs (91% As), respectively, at room temperature, which is an order of magnitude higher than commercially available mid-wave infrared detectors operating at room temperature.</td>

      <td>Defects in conventional semiconductors substantially lower the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a key metric of optoelectronic performance that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as monolayer MoS2, often exhibit low PL QY for as-processed samples, which has typically been attributed to a large native defect density. We show that the PL QY of as-processed MoS2 and WS2 monolayers reaches near-unity when they are made intrinsic through electrostatic doping, without any chemical passivation. Surprisingly, neutral exciton recombination is entirely radiative even in the presence of a high native defect density. This finding enables TMDC monolayers for optoelectronic device applications as the stringent requirement of low defect density is eased.</td>

      <td>Most optoelectronic devices operate at high photocarrier densities, where all semiconductors suffer from enhanced nonradiative recombination. Nonradiative processes proportionately reduce photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a performance metric that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Although transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers exhibit near-unity PL QY at low exciton densities, nonradiative exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) enhanced by van-Hove singularity (VHS) rapidly degrades their PL QY at high exciton densities and limits their utility in practical applications. Here, by applying small mechanical strain (less than 1%), we circumvented VHS resonance and markedly suppressed EEA in monolayer TMDCs, resulting in near-unity PL QY at all exciton densities despite the presence of a high native defect density. Our findings can enable light-emitting devices that retain high efficiency at all brightness levels.</td>

      <td>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has become a powerful analytical tool for addressing unique scientific problems in chemical sciences as well as in materials sciences and other disciplines. There has been a lot of recent interest in the development and applications of liquid phase environmental TEM. In this Account, we review the development and applications of liquid cell TEM for the study of dynamic phenomena at liquid solid interfaces, focusing on two areas: (1) nucleation, growth, and self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals and (2) electrode electrolyte interfaces during charge and discharge processes. We highlight the achievements and progress that have been made in these two topical areas of our studies. For example, tracking single platinum particle growth trajectories revealed that two different pathways of growth, either by monomer attachment or coalescence between nanoparticles, led to the same particle size. With the improved spatial resolution and fast electron detection, we were able to trace individual facet development during platinum nanocube platinum nanocube growth. The results showed that different from the surface energy minimization rule prediction, the growth rates of all low-energy facets, such as {100}, 1114 and {111}, were similar. The {100} facets stopped growth early, and the continuous growth of the rest facets resulted in a nanocube. Density functional theory calculations showed that the amine ligands with low mobility on the {100} facets blocked the further growth of the facets. The effect of the ligand on nanoparticle shape evolution were further studied systematically using a Pt-Fe nanoparticle system by changing the oleylamine concentration. With 20%, 30%, or 50% oleylamine, Pt-Fe nanowires or nanoparticles with different morphologies and stabilities were achieved. Real-time imaging of nanoparticles in solution also enabled the study of interactions between nanoparticles during self-assembly. We further compared the study of noble-metal nanoparticles and transition-metal oxides in a liquid cell to elucidate the nanoparticle formation mechanisms. In the second part of this Account, we review the study of electrolyte electrode interfaces by the development of electrochemical liquid cell TEM. The formation of single-crystalline Pb dendrites from polycrystalline branches and Li dendrite growth in a commercial electrolyte for Li ion batteries were observed. We also studied lithiation reactions of MoS2 and Au electrodes. MoS2 nanoflakes on the Ti electrode underwent irreversible decomposition, resulting in the vanishing of the MoS2 active nanoflakes. More detailed study using nanobeam diffraction indicated that the MoS2 nanoflakes were broken down into small nanoparticles as a result of the fast discharge. For the lithiation of Au electrodes, three distinct types of morphology changes during reactions were revealed, including gradual dissolution, explosive reaction, and local expansion/shrinkage. Additionally, we studied electrolyte decomposition reactions such as bubble formation and solid electrolyte interphase formation. At the end, our perspective on the challenges and opportunities in the applications of liquid phase environmental TEM for the study of liquid chemical reactions is provided.</td>

      <td>Structured liquids, whose 3-D morphology can adapt and respond to external stimuli, represent a revolutionary materials platform for next-generation energy technologies, such as batteries, photovoltaics, and thermoelectrics. Structured liquids can be crafted by the jamming of interfacial assemblies of nanoparticle (NP) surfactants. Due to the interactions between functional groups on nanoparticles dispersed in one liquid and polymers having complementary end-functionality dissolved in a second immiscible fluid, the anchoring of a well-defined number of polymer chains onto the NPs leads to the formation of NP surfactants that assemble at the interface and reduce the interfacial energy. Microfluidic techniques provide a simple and versatile route to produce one liquid phase in a second where the shape of the dispersed liquid phase can range from droplets to tubules depending on the flow conditions and the interfacial energies. In this study, the effect of NP surfactants on Plateau-Rayleigh (PR) instabilities of a free-falling jet of an aqueous dispersion of carboxylic acid functionalized silica NPs into a toluene phase containing amine-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS-NH2) is investigated. NP surfactants were found to significantly affect the breakup of laminar liquid jets, resulting in longer jet breakup lengths and dripping to jetting flow transitions.</td>

      <td>Interfacial assemblies of nanoparticles can stabilize liquid liquid interfaces. Due to the interactions between functional groups on nanoparticles dispersed in one liquid and polymers having complementary end-functionality dissolved in a second immiscible fluid, the anchoring of a well-defined number of polymer chains onto the nanoparticles leads to the formation of NP-surfactants that assemble at the interface and reduce the interfacial energy. We have developed droplet interfaces covered with elastic, responsive monolayers of NP-surfactants. Due to the presence of an elastic layer at the interface, the droplets offer a greater resistance to coalescence and can prevent the exchange of materials across interfaces. Our results show the successful encapsulation of nanoparticles, dyes, and proteins with diameters in the 2.4-30 nm range. Further, we show that stable water-in-oil droplets can be generated for various combinations of polymer ligands and nanoparticles bearing complementary functionalities. These NP-surfactant-stabilized microfluidic emulsions would enable applications requiring liquid liquid interfaces that can adapt and respond to external stimuli and whose mechanical properties can be easily tailored.</td>

A set of computational results are compared to Raman spectra obtained from established experimental databases to estimate the accuracy of the calculated properties across chemical systems and structures.

      <td>The dynamics of molecules or nanoparticles (NPs) at solid-liquid interfaces plays an important role in many natural and industrial processes. However, the effects of a solid-liquid interface on NP motion and on the interactions between these NPs is still not well understood. Here, using in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we directly observed the movement of gold NPs and their aggregation dynamics at solid-liquid interfaces. We found that the solid surfaces transiently pin the NPs during their aggregation, dampening their translational and rotational movements. This surface pinning reduces both the movement of NPs and their aggregation rate as the aggregates grow by attachment. However, the pinning of the NP aggregates affects their translational and rotational motions differently. Initially, with increasing aggregate size, the aggregate's translational motion dampens more than its rotational motion. Consequently, the initial aggregation stages are driven by both the translational and rotational motions, whereas the rotational motion dominates the later aggregation stages. Our results provide insight into the movements of NPs and their aggregates at solid-liquid interfaces, which may assist in the future design and control of NP assemblies at interfaces.</td>

      <td>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising materials for next generation optoelectronic devices. The exciton diffusion length is a critical parameter that reflects the quality of exciton transport in monolayer TMDCs and limits the performance of many excitonic devices. Although diffusion lengths of a few hundred nanometers have been reported in the literature for asexfoliated monolayers, these measurements are convoluted by neutral and charged excitons (trions) that coexist at room. temperature due to natural background doping. Untangling the diffusion of neutral excitons and trionsusingis paramount to understand the fundamental limits and potential of new optoelectronic device architectures made possible TMDCs. In this work, lw.e measure the diffusion lengths of neutral excitons and trions in monolayer MoS2 by tuning the background carrier concentration using a gate voltage and utilizing both steady state and transient. spectroscopy. We observe diffusion lengths of 1.5 mu m and 300 nm for neutral excitons and trions, respectively, at an optical power density of 0.6 W cm(-2).</td>

      <td>The mid-wave infrared (MWIR) wavelength range plays a central role in a variety of applications, including optical gas sensing, industrial process control, spectroscopy, and infrared (IR) countermeasures. Among the MWIR light sources, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have the advantages of simple design, room-temperature operation, and low cost. Owing to the low Auger recombination at high carrier densities and direct bandgap of black phosphorus (bP), it can serve as a high quantum efficiency emitting layer in LEDs. In this work, we demonstrate bP-LEDs exhibiting high external quantum efficiencies and wall-plug efficiencies of up to 4.43 and 1.78%, respectively. This is achieved by integrating the device with an Al2O3/Au optical cavity, which enhances the emission efficiency, and a thin transparent conducing oxide [indium tin oxide (ITO)] layer, which reduces the parasitic resistance, both resulting in order of magnitude improvements to performance.</td>

To date, steady-state monolayer light-emitting devices suffer from Schottky contacts or require complex heterostructures. We demonstrate a transient-mode electro-luminescent device based on transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2) to overcome these problems. Electroluminescence from this dopant-free two-terminal device is obtained by applying an AC voltage between the gate and the semiconductor. Notably, the electroluminescence intensity is weakly dependent on the Schottky barrier height or polarity of the contact. We fabricate a monolayer seven-segment display and achieve the first transparent and bright millimeter-scale light-emitting monolayer semiconductor device.</td>

      <td>Rapid crystallization behavior of amorphous TexSe1-x thin films limits the use of these alloys as coatings and in optoelectronic devices. Understanding the short- and medium-range ordering of the amorphous structure and the fundamental physics governing the crystallization of the films is crucial. Although the lack of long range crystalline order restricts the characterization of the amorphous films, electron microscopy offers a way to extract information about the nanoscale ordering. In this paper, the local ordering of amorphous TexSe1-x thin films with x = 0.22 , 0.61 , 0.70 , 0.90 , and 1 grown by thermal evaporation is investigated using radial distribution function (RDF) and fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM) analysis. RDF results show that the nearest-neighbor distances of selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) in their crystalline structure are preserved, and their bond lengths increase with the addition of Te. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict structures with interatomic distances similar to those measured experimentally. Additionally, fluctuations in atomic coordination are analyzed. Medium range order (MRO) analysis obtained from FEM and DFT calculations suggests that there are at least two populations within the chain network structure, which are close to the Se-Se and Te-Te intrachain distances. For the binary alloy with x &gt; 0.61, TexSe1-x, Te-Te like populations increase and Te fragments might form, suggesting that the glass forming ability decreases rapidly.

      <td>Near-equiatomic multi-component high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have engendered much attention of late due to the remarkable mechanical properties of some of these new metallic materials. In particular, one of the first reported HEAs, the equiatomic, single-phase, face-centered cubic (fcc) alloy CrMnFeCoNi, often termed the Cantor alloy, has been shown to display an exceptional combination of strength, ductility and fracture toughness, Le., damage tolerance, at room temperature, properties that are further enhanced at cryogenic temperatures. Despite this alloy being the most studied HEA to date, its resistance to crack growth under cyclic fatigue loading has not yet been characterized. Here, we examine its fatigue-crack propagation behavior, primarily at lower, near-threshold, growth rates, both at room temperature (293 K) and at 198 K. At 293 K, the alloy shows a fatigue threshold, Delta K-TH, of similar to 4.8 MPa root m, which increases by more than 30% to Delta K-TH similar to 6.3 MPa root m with decrease in temperature to 198 K; additionally, the Paris exponent m was found to increase from roughly 3.5 to 4.5 with decreasing temperature. Examination of the fracture surfaces and crack paths indicate a transition from predominantly transgranular crack propagation at room temperature to intergranular-dominated failure at the lower temperature. Such a change in crack path is generally associated with an increasing degree of physical contact between the two fracture surfaces, Le., roughness-induced fatigue crack closure, which is likely to be the main reason for the difference in the measured thresholds. Additionally, we believe that the higher thresholds found at 198 K are associated with the alloy's higher strength at lower temperatures, which both reduces the crack-tip opening displacements at a given stress-intensity range and prevents plastic deformations of the grains in the wake of the crack.

      <td>Charge density waves (CDW) are states of broken symmetry with a periodic modulation of charge and lattice typically leading to the opening of a gap in the band structure. In the model CDW system 1T-TiSe2 such a gap opens up between its Se-4p valence and Ti-3d conduction band, accompanied by a change of dispersion. These changes are crucial in understanding the CDW phase, as they provide a measure of the Se-4p-Ti-3d hybridization strength and characteristic mechanistic features. Using time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (trARPES), the unoccupied band structure is populated with near-infrared (NIR) pump pulses which allows to directly visualize the parabolically-shaped Ti-3d conduction band. Furthermore, we observe a transient change of effective mass in the Se-4p valence band following photoexcitation. This occurs alongside an overall reduction due to weakening of the CDW phase and is accompanied by an oscillating component with the frequency of the characteristic A(1g) phonon. These observations, enabled by trAPRES, highlight the importance of the lattice contributions in establishing the CDW order in 1T-TiSe2.</td>

      <td>The application of strain to semiconductors allows for controlled modification of their band structure. This principle is employed for the manufacturing of devices ranging from high-performance transistors to solid-state lasers. Traditionally, strain is typically achieved via growth on lattice-mismatched substrates. For two-dimensional (2D)semiconductors, this is not feasible as they typically do not interact epitaxially with the substrate. Here, we demonstrate controlled strain engineering of 2D semiconductors during synthesis by utilizing the thermal coefficient of expansion mismatch between the substrate and semiconductor. Using WSe2 as a model system, we demonstrate stable built-in strains ranging from 1% tensile to 0.2% compressive on substrates with different thermal coefficient of expansion. Consequently, we observe a dramatic modulation of the band structure, manifested by a strain-driven indirect-to-direct bandgap transition and brightening of the dark exciton in bilayer and monolayer WSe2, respectively. The growth method developed here should enable flexibility in design of more sophisticated devices based on 2D materials.</td>

      <td>Mechanical jamming of nanoparticles at liquid-liquid interfaces has evolved into a versatile approach to structure liquids with solid-state properties. Ferromagnetic liquids obtain their physical and magnetic properties, including a remanent magnetization that distinguishes them from ferrofluids, from the jamming of magnetic nanoparticles assembled at the interface between two distinct liquids to minimize surface tension. This perspective provides an overview of recent progress and discusses future directions, challenges and potential applications of jamming magnetic nanoparticles with regard to 3D nano-magnetism. We address the formation and characterization of curved magnetic geometries, and spin frustration between dipole-coupled nanostructures, and advance our understanding of particle jamming at liquid-liquid interfaces.</td>

      <td>Microemulsions, mixtures of oil, water, and surfactant, are thermodynamically stable. Unlike conventional emulsions, microemulsions form spontaneously, have a monodisperse droplet size that can be controlled by adjusting the surfactant concentration, and do not degrade with time. To make microemulsions, a judicious choice of surfactant molecules must be made, which significantly limits their potential use. Nanoparticle surfactants, on the other hand, are a promising alternative because the surface chemistry needed to make them bind to a liquid-liquid interface is both well flexible and understood. Here, we derive a thermodynamic model predicting the conditions in which nanoparticle surfactants drive spontaneous emulsification that agrees quantitatively with experiments using Noria nanoparticles. This new class of microemulsions inherits the mechanical, chemical, and optical properties of the nanoparticles used to form them, leading to novel applications.</td>

      <td>Pourbaix diagrams have been used extensively to evaluate stability regions of materials subject to varying potential and pH conditions in aqueous environments. However, both recent advances in high-throughput material exploration and increasing complexity of materials of interest for electrochemical applications pose challenges for performing Pourbaix analysis on multidimensional systems. Specifically, current Pourbaix construction algorithms incur significant computational costs for systems consisting of four or more elemental components. Herein, we propose an alternative Pourbaix construction method that filters all potential combinations of species in a system to only those present on a compositional convex hull. By including axes representing the quantities of H+ and e(-) required to form a given phase, one can ensure every stable phase mixture is included in the Pourbaix diagram and reduce the computational time required to construct the resultant Pourbaix diagram by several orders of magnitude. This new Pourbaix algorithm has been incorporated into the pymatgen code and the Materials Project website, and it extends the ability to evaluate the Pourbaix stability of complex multicomponent systems.</td>

      <td>Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell efficiencies are limited by parasitic absorption from the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) front contact, but this may be mitigated by selecting an alternative carrier selective contact material with a wider band gap. When choosing such a material as the hole-selective contact (p-layer), the alignment of the material's valence band edge energy (E-VB) with that of crystalline silicon (c-Si) is an important criterion, but several other material parameters can also influence the band bending at the contact interface. In this article, we simulate an (n)c-Si/(i)a-Si:H/p-layer interface to explore the influence of six materials parameters in a variable p-layer on the SHJ performance. We find a strong influence on the fill factor (FF) from thickness, doping, and E-VB, and on V-OC from the interfacial defect density; notably, optimal E-VB is similar to 0.1 eV higher than the valence band edge energy of a-Si:H. Multiparameter sensitivity analyses demonstrate how performance is simultaneously influenced by E-VB and doping; thus, both parameters should be optimized alongside one another. To assess the influence of these parameters experimentally, we grow p-type NiOx as a test-case p-layer, which shows that FFs decrease with the oxygen content likely from the increased misalignment of E-VB. Although modest efficiencies are achieved experimentally (&gt;7%), what is important is that our model simulates performance trends. With these results, we apply a materials discovery pipeline to suggest new materials (e.g., ZnTe and BeTe) to try as p-layers in the SHJ. This combination of simulations, experiments, and materials discovery informs a better understanding of contact selection in SHJ cells.</td>

      <td>Successfully interfacing enzymes and biomachinery with polymers affords on-demand modification and/or programmable degradation during the manufacture, utilization and disposal of plastics, but requires controlled biocatalysis in solid matrices with macromolecular substrates(1-7). Embedding enzyme microparticles speeds up polyester degradation, but compromises host properties and unintentionally acceleratesthe formation of microplastics with partial polymer degradation(6,8,9). Here we showthat by nanoscopically dispersing enzymes with deep active sites, semi-crystalline polyesters can be degraded primarilyvia chain-end-mediated processive depolymerization with programmable latency and material integrity, akin to polyadenylation-induced messenger RNA decay(10). It is also feasible to achieve processivity with enzymes that have surface-exposed active sites by engineering enzyme-protectant-polymer complexes. Poly(caprolactone) and poly(lactic acid) containing less than 2 weight per cent enzymes are depolymerized in days, with up to 98 per cent polymer-to-small-molecule conversion in standard soil composts and household tap water, completely eliminating current needsto separate and landfill their products in compost facilities. Furthermore, oxidases embedded in polyolefins retain their activities. However, hydrocarbon polymers do not closely associate with enzymes, as their polyester counterparts do, and the reactive radicals that are generated cannot chemically modify the macromolecular host. This study provides molecularguidance towards enzyme-polymer pairing and the selection of enzyme protectants to modulate substrate selectivity and optimize biocatalytic pathways. The results also highlight the need for in-depth research in solid-state enzymology, especially in multi-step enzymatic cascades, to tackle chemically dormant substrates without creating secondary environmental contamination and/or biosafety concerns.</td>

      <td>Concentration polarization is an important factor that limits the performance of lithium-ion batteries. While a traditional porous separator provides no barrier for salt depletion at the cathode (during discharge), a functional nonporousseparator could serve as a gateway for minimizing this depletion while allowing lithium-ion transport. We synthesized a triblockcopolymer, poly(styrenesulfonyllithium(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide)-b-polyethylene-b-poly(styrenesulfonyllithium-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (PSLiTFSI-b-PE-b-PSLiTFSI),that self-assembles into nanophase-separated lamellae morphology.Thin membranes obtained through heat pressing this polymer were used as separators in lithium-lithium symmetric cells soaked with liquid electrolytes. Electrochemical experiments on these cells show that our ionic separator slows down salt transport from the cathodic chamber to the anodic chamber by a factor of 4 due to the well-established phenomenon of Donnan exclusion. Our work suggests that ionic separators can serve as a unique gateway to manipulate the concentration polarization, thus providing a potential solution to enable fast charging and discharging of lithium-ion batteries</td>

Knowing the formation and assembly and actively tuning the packing of these NPSs is of significant fundamental interest for the interfacial behavior of nanoparticles and of interest for water purification, drug encapsulation, enhanced oil recovery, and innovative energy transduction applications. Here, we demonstrate by means of interfacial tension measurements the high ionic strength helps the adsorption of NPSs to the water-oil interface leading to, a denser packing of NPSs at the interface. With the reduction of interfacial area, the phase transitions from a gas-like to liquid to solid states of NPSs in two dimensions are observed. Finally, we provide the first in situ real-space imaging of NPSs at the water-oil interface by atomic force microcopy.</td>

      <td>Autonomous experimentation driven by artificial intelligence (AI) provides an exciting opportunity to revolutionize inorganic materials discovery and development. Herein, we review recent progress in the design of self-driving laboratories, including robotics to automate materials synthesis and characterization, in conjunction with AI to interpret experimental outcomes and propose new experimental procedures. We focus on efforts to automate inorganic synthesis through solution-based routes, solid-state reactions, and thin film deposition. In each case, connections are made to relevant work in organic chemistry, where automation is more common. Characterization techniques are primarily discussed in the context of phase identification, as this task is critical to understand what products have formed during synthesis. The application of deep learning to analyze multivariate characterization data and perform phase identification is examined. To achieve closed-loop materials synthesis and design, we further provide a detailed overview of optimization algorithms that use active learning to rationally guide experimental iterations. Finally, we highlight several key opportunities and challenges for the future development of self-driving inorganic materials synthesis platforms.</td>

      <td>Materials are usually classified as solids or liquids, based on their structural stability, dynamic response, and rheological properties. Structured liquid, a new state of matter, has attracted much attention in recent years. Different with either solid or liquid, structured liquid combines the desirable characteristics of fluids with the structural stability of a solid, showing a myriad of potential applications in encapsulation, biphasic reactors, and programmable liquid constructs. Here, a brief review is given, by introducing a new strategy to structure liquids based on the formation, assembly, and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid-liquid interfaces. The interfacial packing of the NPSs can be effectively manipulated using external triggers, endowing the structured liquids with adaptiveness and responsiveness to changes in their external environment.</td>

It was found that the smaller the lateral dimension of the GO sheets, the more rapidly the interfacial tension decreased, and the lower was the interfacial tension between the oil and water. The differences in the rates at which the interfacial tension decreased are related to the diffusion of the GO to the interface, the presentation of the GO at the interface, the degree of functionalization relative to the surface area, and the in-plane motion of the GO to accommodate the arrival of more GO at the interface to effectively cover the interface. The solidlike film formed at the interface had a modulus that increased with decreasing lateral GO dimensions.</td>

      <td>The ability to probe symmetry-breaking transitions on their natural time scales is one of the key challenges in nonequilibrium physics. Stripe ordering represents an intriguing type of broken symmetry, where complex interactions result in atomic-scale lines of charge and spin density. Although phonon anomalies and periodic distortions attest the importance of electron-phonon coupling in the formation of stripe phases, a direct time-domain view of vibrational symmetry breaking is lacking. We report experiments that track the transient multi-terahertz response of the model stripe compound La1.75Sr0.25NiO4, yielding novel insight into its electronic and structural dynamics following an ultrafast optical quench. We find that although electronic carriers are immediately delocalized, the crystal symmetry remains initially frozen-as witnessed by time-delayed suppression of zone-folded Ni-O bending modes acting as a fingerprint of lattice symmetry. Longitudinal and transverse vibrations react with different speeds, indicating a strong directionality and an important role of polar interactions. The hidden complexity of electronic and structural coupling during stripe melting and formation, captured here within a single terahertz spectrum, opens new paths to understanding symmetry-breaking dynamics in solids.</td>

      <td>Thermally evaporated tellurium possesses an intriguing crystallization behavior, where an amorphous to crystalline phase transition happens at near-ambient temperature. However, a comprehensive understanding and delicate control of the crystallization process for the evaporated Te films is lacking. Here, the kinetics and dynamics of the crystallization of thermally evaporated Te films is visualized and modeled. Low-temperature processing of highly crystalline tellurium films with large grain size and preferred out-of-plane orientation ((100) plane parallel to the surface) is demonstrated by controlling the crystallization process. Tellurium single crystals with a lateral dimension of up to 6 mu m are realized on various substrates including glass and plastic. Field-effect transistors based on 5 degrees C crystallized Te single grains (6-nm-thick) exhibit an average effective hole mobility of approximate to 100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), and on/off current ratio of approximate to 3 x 10(4).</td>

      <td>This work addresses the long-standing debate over fractal models of packing structure in metallic glasses (MGs). Through detailed fractal and percolation analyses of MG structures, derived from simulations spanning a range of compositions and quenching rates, we conclude that there is no fractal atomic-level structure associated with the packing of all atoms or solute-centered clusters. The results are in contradiction with conclusions derived from previous studies based on analyses of shifts in radial distribution function and structure factor peaks associated with volume changes induced by pressure and compositional variations. The interpretation of such shifts is shown to be challenged by the heterogeneous nature of MG structure and deformation at the atomic scale. Moreover, our analysis in the present work illustrates clearly the percolation theory applied to MGs, for example, the percolation threshold and characteristics of percolation clusters formed by subsets of atoms, which can have important consequences for structure-property relationships in these amorphous materials.</td>

      <td>Large, freestanding membranes with remarkably high elastic modulus (&gt;10 GPa) have been fabricated through the self-assembly of ligand-stabilized inorganic nanocrystals, even though these nanocrystals are connected only by soft organic ligands (e.g., dodecanethiol or DNA) that are not cross-linked or entangled. Recent developments in the synthesis of polymer-grafted nanocrystals have greatly expanded the library of accessible superlattice architectures, which allows superlattice mechanical behavior to be linked to specific structural features. Here, colloidal self-assembly is used to organize polystyrene-grafted Au nanocrystals at a fluid interface to form ordered solids with sub10-nm periodic features. Thin-film buckling and nanoindentation are used to evaluate the mechanical behavior of polymer-grafted nanocrystal superlattices while exploring the role of polymer structural conformation, nanocrystal packing, and superlattice dimensions. Superlattices containing 3-20 vol % Au are found to have an elastic modulus of similar to 6-19 GPa, and hardness of similar to 120-170 MPa. We find that rapidly self-assembled superlattices have the highest elastic modulus, despite containing significant structural defects. Polymer extension, interdigitation, and grafting density are determined to be critical parameters that govern superlattice elastic and plastic deformation.</td>

      <td>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are an emerging class of advanced structural alloys under extensive research; yet, the properties of the liquid states of these materials, which are relevant to their processing, have been far less explored. In this work, we utilize ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the melt properties of a representative HEA-the Cantor alloy-and its derivatives: CrMnFeCoNi, CrFeCoNi, and CrCoNi. The atomic dynamics of these melts at various temperatures are investigated, specifically to analyze their electronic and atomic structures, including charge transfer, pair distribution functions, and short-range order. Results are compared with existing information for the liquids of metallic glasses, which also typically contain multiple principal elements, but retain the amorphous state under moderate to fast cooling rates. The present results provide insights into the structural and bonding factors favoring solidification to single-phase solid solutions in HEAs. Published by AIP Publishing.</td>

      <td>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are an intriguing new class of metallic materials due to their unique mechanical behavior. Achieving a detailed understanding of structure-property relationships in these materials has been challenged by the compositional disorder that underlies their unique mechanical behavior. Accordingly, in this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the nature of local chemical order and establish its relationship to the intrinsic and extrinsic stacking fault energy (SFE) in CrCoNi medium-entropy solid-solution alloys, whose combination of strength, ductility, and toughness properties approaches the best on record. We find that the average intrinsic and extrinsic SFE are both highly tunable, with values ranging from -43 to 30 mJ.m(-2) and from -28 to 66 mJ.m(-2), respectively, as the degree of local chemical order increases. The state of local ordering also strongly correlates with the energy difference between the face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases, which affects the occurrence of transformation-induced plasticity. This theoretical study demonstrates that chemical short-range order is thermodynamically favored in HEAs and can be tuned to affect the mechanical behavior of these alloys. It thus addresses the pressing need to establish robust processing-structure-property relationships to guide the science-based design of new HEAs with targeted mechanical behavior.</td>

      <td>Despite efforts to develop increasingly targeted and personalized cancer therapeutics, dosing of drugs in cancer chemotherapy is limited by systemic toxic side effects. We have designed, built, and deployed porous absorbers for capturing chemotherapy drugs from the bloodstream after these drugs have had their effect on a tumor, but before they are released into the body where they can cause hazardous side effects. The support structure of the absorbers was built using 3D printing technology. This structure was coated with a nanostructured block copolymer with outer blocks that anchor the polymer chains to the 3D printed support structure and a middle block that has an affinity for the drug. The middle block is polystyrenesulfonate which binds to doxorubicin, a widely used and effective chemotherapy drug with significant toxic side effects. The absorbers are designed for deployment during chemotherapy using minimally invasive image-guided endovascular surgical procedures. We show that the introduction of the absorbers into the blood of swine models enables the capture of 64 +/- 6% of the administered drug (doxorubicin) without any immediate adverse effects. Problems related to blood clots, vein wall dissection, and other biocompatibility issues were not observed. This development represents a significant step forward in minimizing toxic side effects of chemotherapy.</td>

      <td>Using host-guest molecular recognition at the oil-water interface, a new type of photoresponsive nanoparticle surfactant (NPS) was designed and prepared to structure liquids. With the help of a polymeric surfactant, the interfacial host-guest interactions can be significantly enhanced, leading to the rapid formation and assembly of a NP monolayer and offering sufficient binding energy to hold the NPs in a jammed state. The assembly of the NPSs can be reversibly manipulated via a photoswitchable jamming-to-unjamming transition, endowing the interface as well as the macroscopic assemblies with responsiveness to the external trigger (photons). This study for the first time opens a pathway for the construction of multiresponsive, structured all-liquid systems by introducing host-guest chemistry, showing promising potential applications in encapsulation, delivery systems, and unique microfluidic devices.</td>

      <td>Nonlinear optical responses are a crucial probe of physical systems including periodic solids. In the absence of electron-electron interactions, they are calculable with standard perturbation theory starting from the band structure of Bloch electrons, but the resulting formulas are often large and unwieldy, involving many energy denominators from intermediate states. This work gives a Feynman diagram approach to calculating nonlinear responses. This diagrammatic method is a systematic way to perform perturbation theory, which often offers shorter derivations and also provides a natural interpretation of nonlinear responses in terms of physical processes. Applying this method to second-order responses concisely reproduces formulas for the second-order-harmonic shift current. We then apply this method to third-order responses and derive formulas for third-order-harmonic generation and self-focusing of light, which can be directly applied to tight-binding models. Third-order responses in the semiclasscial regime include a Berry curvature quadrupole term, whose importance is discussed including symmetry considerations and when the Berry curvature quadrupole becomes the leading contribution. The method is applied to compute third-order optical responses for a model Weyl semimetal, where we find a new topological contribution that diverges in a clean material, as well as resonances with a peculiar linear character.</td>

      <td>There currently exist no quantitative methods to determine the appropriate conditions for solid-state synthesis. This not only hinders the experimental realization of novel materials but also complicates the interpretation and understanding of solid-state reaction mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate a machine-learning approach that predicts synthesis conditions using large solid-state synthesis data sets text-mined from scientific journal articles. Using feature importance ranking analysis, we discovered that optimal heating temperatures have strong correlations with the stability of precursor materials quantified using melting points and formation energies (&amp; UDelta;Gf, &amp; UDelta;Hf). In contrast, features derived from the thermodynamics of synthesis-related reactions did not directly correlate to the chosen heating temperatures. This correlation between optimal solid-state heating temperature and precursor stability extends Tamman's rule from intermetallics to oxide systems, suggesting the importance of reaction kinetics in determining synthesis conditions. Heating times are shown to be strongly correlated with the chosen experimental procedures and instrument setups, which may be indicative of human bias in the data set. Using these predictive features, we constructed machine-learning models with good performance and general applicability to predict the conditions required to synthesize diverse chemical systems.</td>

However, the current informatics infrastructure has yet to unlock the full knowledge available within existing datasets or to explore connections between different materials science domains. Here, we present a streamlined system for codifying and connecting materials properties in an open-source Python framework: propnet. We demonstrate the capability of this framework to augment existing datasets of materials properties: by consecutively applying a network of physical relationships to calculate related information, propnet connects disparate domain knowledge. Beyond an immediate increase in available information, the results allow for the examination of correlations between sets of properties and guide the design of multifunctional materials. By emphasizing code extensibility and simplicity, we offer this software to the materials science community for general application to any experimental or computationally derived materials database.</td>

      <td>Fundamental molecular-level understanding of functional properties of liquid solutions provides an important basis for designing optimized electrolytes for numerous applications. In particular, exhaustive knowledge of solvation structure, stability, and transport properties is critical for developing stable electrolytes for fast-charging and high-energy-density next-generation energy storage systems. Accordingly, there is growing interest in the rational design of electrolytes for beyond lithium-ion systems by tuning the molecular-level interactions of solvate species present in the electrolytes. Here we present a review of the solvation structure of multivalent electrolytes and its impact on the electrochemical performance of these batteries. A direct correlation between solvate species present in the solution and macroscopic properties of electrolytes is sparse for multivalent electrolytes and contradictory results have been reported in the literature. This review aims to illustrate the current understanding, compare results, and highlight future needs and directions to enable the deep understanding needed for the rational design of improved multivalent electrolytes.</td>

      <td>Taking advantage of the formation and assembly of cellulose nanocrystal surfactants (CNCSs) at the water-oil interface, where polar cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and end-functionalized polymer chains interact, the preparation and stability of emulsions prepared with CNCSs were investigated. The packing density of CNCSs at the interface can be adjusted by tuning parameters such as pH, ionic strength, and concentration/molecular weight of the end-functionalized polymer ligands. Stable non-spherical emulsions are obtained during homogenization, as a result of the interfacial jamming of CNCSs, with pH-triggered reconfigurability. Porous materials are prepared by freeze-drying creamed, CNCS-stabilized emulsions. The cells of the porous materials have a controlled pore size and shape that are commensurate with the droplets in the emulsion and are responsive to pH. The behavior of the adaptive, reconfigurable supracolloidal system is coupled to its internal and surrounding environment.</td>

      <td>Structured liquids, generated by the interfacial formation, assembly, and jamming of nanoparticle (NP)-surfactants at liquid/liquid interfaces, maintain all the desirable characteristics of each liquid, while providing a spatially structured framework. Herein, we show that rod-like cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)-based NP-surfactants, termed CNC-surfactants, are formed rapidly at the liquid/liquid interface, assemble into a monolayer, and, when jammed, offer a robust assembly with exceptional mechanical properties. Plateau-Rayleigh (PR) instabilities of a free-falling jet of an aqueous medium containing the CNCs into a toluene solution of amine end-functionalized polystyrene are completely suppressed, allowing the jetting of aqueous tubules that are stabilized when the CNC-surfactants are jammed at the interface. These results open a new platform for the additive manufacturing techniques, for example, three-dimensional (3D) printing, of all-liquid constructs.</td>

      <td>Fire poses a substantial threat to concrete structures because calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) is not thermally stable at high temperatures. Herein, in situ TEM at temperatures from 20 to 800 degrees C was conducted to study the thermal-induced structural changes in C-S-H. We captured C-S-H shrinks at an average rate of 0.02 mu m(2)/degrees C upon heating with three stages observed, including induction, constant, and rapid periods. Our observation revealed that an 800 nm pore could be healed during pore structure evolution owing to the reconstruction and deformation among C-S-H blocks. The Ca/Si ratio was dropped at higher temperatures because of the leakage of calcium ions from the C-S-H structure to form CaO precipitates. The temperature-driven phase transformation and degradation were also detected using electron diffraction that C-S-H was transformed into metastable calcium silicate minerals above 800 degrees C. This work provides insights into the nanoscale transformation of C-S-H at high temperatures.</td>

      <td>The effect of polymer surfactant structure and concentration on the self-assembly, mechanical properties, and solidification of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the oil-water interface was studied. The surface tension of the oil-water interface was found to depend strongly on the choice of the polymer surfactant used to assemble the NPSs, with polymer surfactants bearing multiple polar groups being the most effective at reducing interfacial tension and driving the NPS assembly. By contrast, only small variations in the shear modulus of the system were observed, suggesting that it is determined largely by particle density. In the presence of polymer surfactants bearing multiple functional groups, NPS assemblies on pendant drop surfaces were observed to spontaneously solidify above a critical polymer surfactant concentration. Interfacial solidification accelerated rapidly as polymer surfactant concentration was increased. On long timescales after solidification, pendant drop interfaces were observed to spontaneously wrinkle at sufficiently low surface tensions (approximately 5 mN m(-1)). Interfacial shear rheology of the NPS assemblies was elastic-dominated, with the shear modulus ranging from 0.1 to 1 N m(-1), comparable to values obtained for nanoparticle monolayers elsewhere. Our work paves the way for the development of designer, multicomponent oil-water interfaces with well-defined mechanical, structural, and functional properties.</td>

      <td>The nuclear shielding anisotropy, zeta, is a useful nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shielding tensor parameter in describing the extent of electron cloud distortion about an atom. Despite the advantages afforded by NMR in structural characterization, the relationship between. and local structure of an atom in high-symmetry environments, such as Si-Q4 sites, is poorly understood. Here, we use a data-driven approach combining random forest feature ranking and the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) approach to derive a simple and accurate geometric descriptor for zeta with a root-meansquared prediction error of 6.77 ppm and an R-2 of 0.761. We then apply this descriptor to describe the local geometric distortion of zeolites Sigma-2 and silica-ZSM-5 whose chemical shift anisotropy tensor has been reported. We envision that this geometric descriptor will allow for structural description and refinement in previously difficult-to-describe materials.</td>

      <td>Liquids lack the spatial order required for advanced functionality. Interfacial assemblies of colloids, however, can be used to shape liquids into complex, 3D objects, simultaneously forming 2D layers with novel magnetic, plasmonic, or structural properties. Fully exploiting all-liquid systems that are structured by their interfaces would create a new class of biomimetic, reconfigurable, and responsive materials. Here, printed constructs of water in oil are presented. Both form and function are given to the system by the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants, formed from the interfacial interaction of nanoparticles and amphiphilic polymers that bear complementary functional groups. These yield dissipative constructs that exhibit a compartmentalized response to chemical cues. Potential applications include biphasic reaction vessels, liquid electronics, novel media for the encapsulation of cells and active matter, and dynamic constructs that both alter, and are altered by, their external environment.</td>

      <td>Thermodynamic equations of state (EOS) for crystalline solids describe material behaviors under changes in pressure, volume, entropy and temperature, making them fundamental to scientific research in a wide range of fields including geophysics, energy storage and development of novel materials. Despite over a century of theoretical development and experimental testing of energy-volume (E-V) EOS for solids, there is still a lack of consensus with regard to which equation is indeed optimal, as well as to what metric is most appropriate for making this judgment. In this study, several metrics were used to evaluate quality of fit for 8 different EOS across 87 elements and over 100 compounds which appear in the literature. Our findings do not indicate a clear best EOS, but we identify three which consistently perform well relative to the rest of the set. Furthermore, we find that for the aggregate data set, the RMSrD is not strongly correlated with the nature of the compound, e.g., whether it is a metal, insulator, or semiconductor, nor the bulk modulus for any of the EOS, indicating that a single equation can be used across a broad range of classes of materials.</td>

Flow channels are fabricated using micropatterned 2D substrates and liquid-in-liquid 3D printing. The anionic walls of the device can be functionalized with cationic small molecules, enzymes, and colloidal nanocrystal catalysts. Multi-step chemical transformations can be conducted within the channels under flow, as can selective mass transport across the liquid-liquid interface for in-line separations. These all-liquid systems become automated using pumps, detectors, and control systems, revealing a latent ability for chemical logic and learning.</td>

      <td>Future lithium (Li) energy storage technologies, in particular solid-state configurations with a Li metal anode, opens up the possibility of using cathode materials that do not necessarily contain Li in its as-made state. To accelerate the discovery and design of such materials, we develop a general, chemically, and structurally agnostic methodology for identifying the optimal Li sites in any crystalline material. For a given crystal structure, we attempt multiple Li insertions at symmetrically in-equivalent positions by analyzing the electronic charge density obtained from first-principles density functional theory. In this report, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure in successfully identifying the positions of the Li ion in well-known cathode materials using only the empty host (charged) material as guidance. Furthermore, applying the algorithm to over 2000 candidate cathode empty host materials we obtain statistics of Li site preferences to guide future developments of novel Li-ion cathode materials, particularly for solid-state applications.</td>

      <td>Ab initio methods provide a powerful tool in the search for novel polar materials. In particular, there has been a surge to identify lead-free piezoelectric materials to replace PbZr0.52Ti0.48OSr2Nb2O7. This study examines a computational strategy to identify increased piezoelectric and dielectric responses of alloy systems based on the linear interpolation of force constants, Born effective charges, and internal strain tensors from their end-point compounds. We choose the ferroelectric layered perovskite Sr2Nb2O7 as a parent structure and employ this alloying strategy for 19 potential cation substitutions, targeting thermodynamically metastable alloys with high piezoelectric response. From this screening, we identify Sr2Nb2-2xV2xO7 as a promising polar system. We conduct large-unit-cell calculations of Sr2Nb2-2xV2xO7 at x = 0.0625, 0.125 for multiple cation orderings and find a significant 184% enhanced piezoelectric response. The solid solution system is synthesized as single-crystalline thin-film heterostructures using pulsed-laser deposition, and an enhanced dielectric response is observed at x = 0.05 and at x = 0.1. We present the Sr2Nb2-2xV2xO7 alloy system designed through high-throughput computational screening methods with a large calculated piezoelectric response and experimentally verified increased dielectric response. Our methodology is provided as a high-throughput screening tool for novel materials with enhanced polarizability and alloy systems with potential morphotropic phase boundaries.</td>

      <td>Exciton polaritons (EPs) are partial light partialmatter quasiparticles in semiconductors demonstrating striking quantum phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation and single-photon nonlinearity. In these phenomena, the governing process is the EP relaxation into the ground states upon excitation, where various mechanisms are extensively investigated with thermodynamic limits. However, the relaxation process becomes drastically different and could significantly advance the understanding of EP dynamics for these quantum phenomena, when excited states of EPs are involved. Here, for the first time, we observe nonlinear optical responses at the EP excited states in a monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) microcavity, including dark excited states and dynamically metastable upper polariton bands. The nonlinear optics leads to unique emissions of ground states with prominent valley degree of freedom (DOF) via an anomalous relaxation process, which is applicable to a wide range of semiconductors from monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to emerging halide perovskites. This work promises possible approaches to challenging experiments such as valley polariton condensation. Moreover, it also constructs a valleydependent solid-state three-level system for terahertz photonics and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage.</td>

      <td>Coordination numbers and geometries form a theoretical framework for understanding and predicting materials properties. Algorithms to determine coordination numbers automatically are increasingly used for machine learning (ML) and automatic structural analysis. In this work, we introduce MaterialsCoord, a benchmark suite containing 56 experimentally derived crystal structures (spanning elements, binaries, and ternary compounds) and their corresponding coordination environments as described in the research literature. We also describe CrystalNN, a novel algorithm for determining near neighbors. We compare CrystalNN against seven existing near-neighbor algorithms on the MaterialsCoord benchmark, finding CrystalNN to perform similarly to several well-established algorithms. For each algorithm, we also assess computational demand and sensitivity toward small perturbations that mimic thermal motion. Finally, we investigate the similarity between bonding algorithms when applied to the Materials Project database. We expect that this work will aid the development of coordination prediction algorithms as well as improve structural descriptors for ML and other applications.</td>

The AFM results show that the strength of the interactions between the CNCs and the ligands dictates the response of the CNCS assemblies to an applied compress whether the assemblies wrinkle or buckle or if the orientation of the CNCSs with respect to the interfaces is changed. AFM force curve measurements provide an alternative route to evaluate the interfacial tension and, more importantly, allow quantitative evaluation of the strength of interactions between the CNCs assembled at the interface.</td>

      <td>Optical constants characterize the interaction of materials with light and are important properties in material design. Here we present a Python-based Corvus workflow for simulations of full spectrum optical constants from the visible and ultraviolet to hard x-ray wavelengths based on the real-space Green's function code FEFF10 and structural data from the Materials Project (MP). The Corvus workflow manager and its associated tools provide an interface to FEFF10 and the MP database. The workflow parallelizes the FEFF computations of optical constants over all absorption edges for each material in the MP database specified by a unique MP-ID. The workflow tools determine the distribution of computational resources needed for that case. Similarly, the optical constants for selected sets of materials can be computed in a single-shot. To illustrate the approach, we present results for several elemental solids in the periodic table, as well as a sample compound, and compare our predictions with experimental results. In addition, we provide a database of calculated results for all elements for which there is a stable elemental solid at standard conditions available in the Materials Project database. As in x-ray absorption spectra, these results are interpreted in terms of an atomic-like background and fine-structure contributions.</td>

      <td>High-entropy alloys (HEAs), although often presumed to be random solid solutions, have recently been shown to display nanometer-scale variations in the arrangements of their multiple chemical elements. Here, we study the effects of this compositional heterogeneity in HEAs on their mechanical properties using in situ compression testing in the transmission electron microscope (TEM), combined with molecular dynamics simulations. We report an anomalous size effect on the yield strength in HEAs, arising from such compositional heterogeneity. By progressively reducing the sample size, HEAs initially display the classical smaller-is-stronger phenomenon, similar to pure metals and conventional alloys. However, as the sample size is decreased below a critical characteristic length (similar to 180 nm), influenced by the size-scale of compositional heterogeneity, a transition from homogeneous deformation to a heterogeneous distribution of planar slip is observed, coupled with an anomalous smaller-is-weaker size effect. Atomic-scale computational modeling shows these observations arise due to compositional fluctuations over a few nanometers. These results demonstrate the efficacy of influencing mechanical properties in HEAs through control of local compositional variations at the nanoscale.</td>

      <td>Two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly black phosphorus (bP), have demonstrated themselves to be excellent candidates for high-performance infrared photodetectors and transistors. However, high-quality bP can be obtained only via mechanical exfoliation from high-temperature- and high-pressure-grown bulk crystals and degrades rapidly when exposed to ambient conditions. Here, we report solution-synthesized and air-stable quasi-2D tellurium (Te) nanoflakes for short-wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors. We perform comprehensive optical characterization via polarization-resolved transmission and reflection measurements and report the absorbance and complex refractive index of Te crystals. It is found that this material is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 0.31 eV. From temperature dependent electrical measurements, we confirm this band-gap value and find that 12 nm thick Te nanoflakes show high hole mobilities of 450 and 1430 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 300 and 77 K, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that despite its indirect band gap, Te can be utilized for high-performance SWIR photodetectors by employing optical cavity substrates consisting of Au/Al2O3 to dramatically increase the absorption in the semiconductor. By changing the thickness of the Al2O3 cavity, the peak responsivity of Te photoconductors can be tuned from 1.4 mu m (13 A/W) to 2.4 mu m (8 A/W) with a cutoff wavelength of 3.4 fully capturing the SWIR band. An optimized room-temperature specific detectivity (D*) of 2 X 10(9) cm Hz(1/2) W-1 is obtained at a wavelength of 1.7 mu m.</td>

      <td>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been a hot research topic in the last decade, due to novel fundamental physics in the reduced dimension and appealing applications. Systematic discovery of functional 2D materials has been the focus of many studies. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D materials, with more than 6,000 monolayer structures, obtained from both top-down and bottom-up discovery procedures. First, we screened all bulk materials in the database of Materials Project for layered structures by a topology-based algorithm and theoretically exfoliated them into monolayers. Then, we generated new 2D materials by chemical substitution of elements in known 2D materials by others from the same group in the periodic table. The structural, electronic and energetic properties of these 2D materials are consistently calculated, to provide a starting point for further material screening, data mining, data analysis and artificial intelligence applications. We present the details of computational methodology, data record and technical validation of our publicly available data (http://www.2dmatpedia.org/).</td>

      <td>The work function is a fundamental electronic property of a solid that varies with the facets of a crystalline surface. It is a crucial parameter in spectroscopy as well as materials design, especially for technologies such as thermionic electron guns and Schottky barriers. In this work, we present the largest database of calculated work functions for elemental crystals to date. This database contains the anisotropic work functions of more than 100 polymorphs of about 72 elements and up to a maximum Miller index of two and three for non-cubic and cubic crystals, respectively. The database has been rigorously validated against previous experimental and computational data where available. We also propose a weighted work function based on the Wulff shape that can be compared to measurements from polycrystalline specimens, and show that this weighted work function can be modeled empirically using simple atomic parameters. Furthermore, for the first time, we were able to analyze simple bond breaking rules for metallic systems beyond a maximum Miller index of one, allowing for a more generalized investigation of work function anisotropy.</td>

      <td>TOPOLOGICAL INSULATOR</td>
      <td>Topological insulators have been shown to exhibit strong and long-lived surface photovoltages when excited by an infrared pump. The ability to generate long-lived potentials on these surfaces provides opportunities to manipulate the spin-momentum locked topological surface states. Moreover, the photo-induced nature of this effect allows for localized excitation of arbitrary geometries. Knowing precisely how these potentials form and evolve is critical in understanding how to manage the effect in applications. The uniqueness of the photoemission experimental geometry, in which the photoelectron must traverse the induced surface field in vacuum, provides an interesting probe of the electric dipole shape generated by the surface photovoltage. In this study, we are able to match the observed decay of the geometric effect on the photoelectron to an essential electrodynamics model of the light-induced dipole thereby tracking the fluence-dependent evolution of the dipole geometry. By utilizing a standard time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission experiment, we are able to determine real-space information of the dipole while simultaneously recovering time-resolved band structure.</td>

      <td>Current high-performing piezoelectric materials are dominated by perovskites that rely on soft optical phonon modes stabilized by disorder near a morphotropic phase boundary and a unique resilience of the polar response to that disorder. To identify structural families with similar resilience, we develop a first-principles sensitivity analysis approach to determine the effect of disorder on the piezoelectric response for structures in the Materials Project database. In well-known piezoelectric systems, the lattice dynamics, rather than internal strain or dielectric, control the polar response. Additionally, multiple stable optical phonon modes are found to contribute to the piezoelectric response, providing a fingerprint for disorder tolerance. A multiple-phonon mode criterion is used to evaluate candidate materials for disorder-tolerant piezoelectric prototype systems. Five promising structures are altered through chemical substitution, generating potential MPB end points with large piezoelectric responses beyond perovskites including Akermanite Sr2xCa2-2xCoSi2O7, which exhibits a nearly 20% increase in response at the 50% composition.</td>

      <td>Using the interfacial jamming of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) surfactants, a new concept, termed all-liquid molding, is introduced to produce all-liquid objects that retain the shape and details of the mold with high fidelity, yet remain all liquid and are responsive to external stimuli. This simple process, where the viscosity of the CNC dispersion can range from that of water to a crosslinked gel, opens tremendous opportunities for encapsulation, delivery systems, and unique microfluidic devices. The process described is generally applicable to any functionalized nanoparticles dispersed in one liquid and polymer ligands having complementary functionality dissolved in a second immiscible liquid. Such sculpted liquids retain all the characteristics of the liquids but retain shape indefinitely, very much like a solid, and provide a new platform for next-generation soft materials.</td>

Here, we describe the design and construction of DNA microcapsules using the cooperative assembly of DNA and amine-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS-NH2) at the oil-water interface. Janus-like DNA surfactants (DNASs) assemble in situ at the interface, forming an elastic film. By controlling the jamming and unjamming behavior of DNASs, the interfacial assemblies can assume three different physical states: solid-like, elastomer-like, and liquid-like, similar to that seen with thermoplastics upon heating, that change from a glassy to a rubbery state, and then to a viscous liquid. By the interfacial jamming of DNASs, the liquid structures can be locked-in and reconfigured, showing promising potentials for drug delivery, biphasic reactors, and programmable liquid constructs.</td>

      <td>Two-dimensional (2D) noble-metal dichalcogenides exhibit exceptionally strong thickness-dependent bandgaps, which can be leveraged in a wide variety of device applications. A detailed study of their optical (e.g., optical bandgaps) and electrical properties (e.g., mobilities) is important in determining potential future applications of these materials. In this work, we perform detailed optical and electrical characterization of 2D PdSe2 nanoflakes mechanically exfoliated from a single-crystalline source. Layer-dependent bandgap analysis from optical absorption results indicates that this material is an indirect semiconductor with bandgaps of approximately 1.37 and 0.50eV for the monolayer and bulk, respectively. Spectral photoresponse measurements further confirm these bandgap values. Moreover, temperature-dependent electrical measurements of a 6.8-nm-thick PdSe2 flake-based transistor show effective electron mobilities of 130 and 520cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) at 300K and 77K, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that PdSe2 can be utilized for short-wave infrared photodetectors. A room-temperature specific detectivity (D-*) of 1.8x10(10)cm Hz(1/2) W-1 at 1 mu m with a band edge at 1.94 mu m is achieved on a 6.8-nm-thick PdSe2 flake-based photodetector.</td>

      <td>Semiconducting absorbers in high-performance short-wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors and imaging sensor arrays are dominated by single-crystalline germanium and III-V semiconductors. However, these materials require complex growth and device fabrication procedures. Here, thermally evaporated Se(x)Te(1-)(x)alloy thin films with tunable bandgaps for the fabrication of high-performance SWIR photodetectors are reported. From absorption measurements, it is shown that the bandgaps of Se(x)Te(1-)(x)films can be tuned continuously from 0.31 eV (Te) to 1.87 eV (Se). Owing to their tunable bandgaps, the peak responsivity position and photoresponse edge of Se(x)Te(1-)(x)film-based photoconductors can be tuned in the SWIR regime. By using an optical cavity substrate consisting of Au/Al(2)O(3)to enhance its absorption near the bandgap edge, the Se(0.32)Te(0.68)film (an optical bandgap of approximate to 0.8 eV)-based photoconductor exhibits a cut-off wavelength at approximate to 1.7 mu m and gives a responsivity of 1.5 AW(-1)and implied detectivity of 6.5 x 10(10)cm Hz(1/2)W(-1)at 1.55 mu m at room temperature. Importantly, the nature of the thermal evaporation process enables the fabrication of Se0.32Te0.68-based 42 x 42 focal plane arrays with good pixel uniformity, demonstrating the potential of this unique material system used for infrared imaging sensor systems.</td>

      <td>This article presents an overview of three challenging issues that are currently being debated in the community researching on the evolution of amorphous structures in metallic glasses and their parent supercooled liquids. Our emphasis is on the valuable insights acquired in recent computational analyses that have supplemented experimental investigations. The first idea is to use the local structural order developed, and in particular its evolution during undercooling, as a signature indicator to rationalize the experimentally observed temperature-dependence of viscosity, hence suggesting a possible structural origin of liquid fragility. The second issue concerns with the claim that the average nearest-neighbor distance in metallic melts contracts rather than expands upon heating, concurrent with a reduced coordination number. This postulate is, however, based on the shift of the first peak maximum in the pair distribution function and an average bond length determined from nearest neighbors designated using a distance cutoff. These can instead be a result of increasing skewness of the broad first peak, upon thermally exacerbated asymmetric distribution of neighboring atoms activated to shorter and longer distances under the anharmonic interatomic interaction potential. The third topic deals with crystal-like peak positions in the pair distribution function of metallic glasses. These peak locations can be explained using various connection schemes of coordination polyhedra, and found to be present already in high-temperature liquids without hidden crystal order. We also present an outlook to invite more in-depth computational research to fully settle these issues in future, and to establish more robust structure-property relations in amorphous alloys.</td>

      <td>A Gibbs monolayer of jammed, or nearly jammed, spherical nanoparticles was imaged at a liquid surface in real time by in-situ scanning electron microscopy performed at the single-particle level. At nanoparticle areal fractions above that for the onset of two-dimensional crystallization, structural reorganizations of the mobile polymer-coated particles were visualized after a stepwise areal compression. When the compression was small, slow shearing near dislocations and reconfigured nanoparticle bonding were observed at crystal grain boundaries. At larger scales, domains grew as they rotated into registry by correlated but highly intermittent motions. Simultaneously, the areal density in the middle of the monolayer increased. When the compression was large, the jammed monolayers exhibited out-of-plane deformations such as wrinkles and bumps. Due to their large interfacial binding energy, few (if any) of the two-dimensionally mobile nanoparticles returned to the liquid subphase. Compressed long enough (several hours or more), monolayers transformed into solid nanoparticle films, as evidenced by their cracking and localized rupturing upon subsequent areal expansion. These observations provide mechanistic insights into the dynamics of a simple model system that undergoes jamming/unjamming in response to mechanical stress.</td>

      <td>The measurement of electrical activity across systems of excitable cells underlies current progress in neuroscience, cardiac pharmacol-ogy, and neurotechnology. However, bioelectricity spans orders of magnitude in intensity, space, and time, posing substantial technological challenges. The development of methods permitting network-scale recordings with high spatial resolution remains key to studies of electrogenic cells, emergent networks, and bioelectric computation. Here, we demonstrate single-shot and label-free imaging of extracellular potentials with high resolution across a wide field-of-view. The critically coupled waveguide-amplified graphene electric field (CAGE) sensor leverages the field-sensitive optical transitions in graphene to convert electric potentials into the optical regime. As a proof-of-concept, we use the CAGE sensor to detect native electrical activity from cardiac action potentials with tens-of-microns resolution, simultaneously map the propagation of these potentials at tissue-scale, and monitor their modification by pharmacological agents. This platform is robust, scalable, and compatible with existing microscopy techniques for multimodal correlative imaging.</td>

      <td>The appearance of topologically protected spin-momentum locked surface states in topological insulators gives rise to robust room temperature spin currents making them ideal candidates for the realization of spintronic devices. New methods are needed to access and manipulate such currents with timescales that are compatible with modern electronics. Here we reveal that an optically induced long-lived (similar to 10 ns), spin-polarized surface state excitation in topological insulators can be easily tuned in both magnitude and duration. Time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, together with a quantitative model, reveals the ideal conditions for a surface photovoltage in two different topological insulators. Our model predicts that the reported effects are an intrinsic property of topological insulators, as long as the chemical potential falls within the band gap. This work demonstrates that persistent excited topological surface states are photon-accessible and easily tuned in both magnitude and duration, merging photonics- and spintronics-based devices in the same material.</td>

      <td>Nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) assembled at the oil-water interface can significantly lower the interfacial tension and be used to structure liquids. However, to realize the three-dimensional printing of one liquid in another, high-viscosity liquids, for example, silicone oil, have been generally used. Here, we present a simple, low-cost approach to print water in low-viscosity toluene by using a new type of polyelectrolyte surfactant, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose surfactant (CMCS), that forms and assembles at the oil-water interface. The interfacial activity of CMCSs can be enhanced by tuning parameters, such as pH and concentration, and the incorporation of a rigid ligand affords excellent mechanical strength to the resultant assemblies. With CMCS jammed at the interface, liquids can be easily printed or molded to the desired shapes, with biocompatible walls that can be used to encapsulate and adsorb active materials. This study opens a new pathway to generate complex, all-liquid devices with a myriad of potential applications in biology, catalysis, and chemical separation.</td>

      <td>Moire patterns of transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers have proved to be an ideal platform on which to host unusual correlated electronic phases, emerging magnetism and correlated exciton physics. Whereas the existence of new moire excitonic states is established(1-4) through optical measurements, the microscopic nature of these states is still poorly understood, often relying on empirically fit models. Here, combining large-scale first-principles GW (where G and W denote the one-particle Green's function and the screened Coulomb interaction, respectively) plus Bethe-Salpeter calculations and micro-reflection spectroscopy, we identify the nature of the exciton resonances in WSe2/WS2 moire superlattices, discovering a rich set of moire excitons that cannot be captured by prevailing continuum models. Our calculations show moire excitons with distinct characters, including modulated Wannier excitons and previously unidentified intralayer charge-transfer excitons. Signatures of these distinct excitonic characters are confirmed experimentally by the unique carrier-density and magnetic-field dependences of different moire exciton resonances. Our study highlights the highly non-trivial exciton states that can emerge in transition metal dichalcogenide moire superlattices, and suggests new ways of tuning many-body physics in moire systems by engineering excited-states with specific spatial characters.</td>

      <td>In the past decade, a thriving family of 2D nanomaterials, transition-metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes), have garnered tremendous interest due to its intriguing physical/chemical properties, structural features, and versatile functionality. Integrating these 2D nanosheets into 3D monoliths offers an exciting and powerful platform for translating their fundamental advantages into practical applications. Introducing internal pores, such as isotropic pores and aligned channels, within the monoliths can not only address the restacking of MXenes, but also afford a series of novel and, in some cases, unique structural merits to advance the utility of the MXene-based materials. Here, a brief overview of the development of MXene-based porous monoliths, in terms of the types of microstructures, is provided, focusing on the pore design and how the porous microstructure affects the application performance.</td>

      <td>Multivalent batteries are an energy storage technology with the potential to surpass lithium-ion batteries; however, their performance have been limited by the low voltages and poor solid-state ionic mobility of available cathodes. A computational screening approach to identify high-performance multivalent intercalation cathodes among materials that do not contain the working ion of interest has been developed, which greatly expands the search space that can be considered for material discovery. This approach has been applied to magnesium cathodes as a proof of concept, and four resulting candidate materials [NASICON V2(PO4)3, birnessite NaMn4O8, tavorite MnPO4F, and spinel MnO2] are discussed in further detail. In examining the ion migration environment and associated Mg2+ migration energy in these materials, local energy maxima are found to correspond with pathway positions where Mg2+ passes through a plane of anion atoms. While previous studies have established the influence of local coordination on multivalent ion mobility, these results suggest that considering both the type of the local bonding environment and available free volume for the mobile ion along its migration pathway can be significant for improving solid-state mobility.</td>

HOTPP interacts with the P4VP block by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group of HOTPP and pyridine ring of PS19-b-P4VP(5), forming cylindrical P4VP(HOTPP) domains having an average diameter of similar to 17 nm in a PS matrix. Dynamic light scattering, contact angle, and in situ grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering measurements show a morphological transition from spherical micelles in solution to cylindrical microdomains oriented normal to the substrate surface during the drying process. From the dependence of current on voltage, an average current of similar to 4.0 nA is found to pass through a single microdomain, pointing to a promising route for organic semiconductor device applications.</td>

      <td>Hierarchical assemblies from block copolymer (BCP)-based supramolecules have shown immense potential as programmable materials owing to their versatility for incorporating functional molecules and provide access to arrays of hierarchical structures. However, there remains a knowledge gap on the formation of the supramolecule in solution. Here, we applied NMR techniques to investigate the solution-phase behavior of the most studied supramolecular systems, polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine)(3-pentadecylphenol) (PS-b-P4VP(PDP)(r)). The results show that the supramolecule likely adopts a coil-comb conformation, despite the small molecule's (PDP) rapid exchange between the bonded and free states. The exchange rate (&gt;10(4) s(-1)) exceeds the NMR time scale at the frequency of interest. The supramolecules form under dilute conditions (similar to 2, vol %) and are attributed to the enthalpic gain of the hydrogen bonding between the PDP and 4VP. As the solute concentration increases (&gt;10 vol %), the supramolecule forms micelle-like aggregates with PDP accumulated within the comb-block's pervaded volume based on analysis of the apparent molecular weight, viscosity, and chain dynamics. This work sheds light on the long-standing question regarding the evolution of the constituents in the BCP-based supramolecule in solution and provides valuable guidance toward their solution-based processing and morphological control.</td>

      <td>The spatial arrangement of adsorbates deposited onto a clean surface under vacuum typically cannot be reversibly tuned. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to demonstrate that molecules deposited onto graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) exhibit reversible, electrically tunable surface concentration. Continuous gate-tunable control over the surface concentration of charged F(4)TCNQ molecules was achieved on a graphene FET at T = 4.5K. This capability enables the precisely controlled impurity doping of graphene devices and also provides a new method for determining molecular energy level alignment based on the gate-dependence of molecular concentration. Gate-tunable molecular concentration is explained by a dynamical molecular rearrangement process that reduces total electronic energy by maintaining Fermi level pinning in the device substrate. The molecular surface concentration is fully determined by the device back-gate voltage, its geometric capacitance, and the energy difference between the graphene Dirac point and the molecular LUMO level.</td>

      <td>The prevention of fragility fractures in bone-pathologic fractures resulting from daily activity and mostly occurring in the elderly population-has been a long-term clinical quest. Recent research indicating that falls in the elderly might be the consequence of fracture rather than its cause has raised fundamental questions about the origin of fragility fractures. Is day-to-day cyclic loading, instead of a single-load event such as a fall, the main cause of progressively growing fractures? Are fragility fractures predominantly affected by bone quality rather than bone mass, which is the clinical indicator of fracture risk? Do osteocytes actively participate in the bone repair process? In this Perspective, we discuss the central role of cyclic fatigue in bone fragility fracture.</td>

      <td>Electron-hole asymmetry is a fundamental property in solids that can determine the nature of quantum phase transitions and the regime of operation for devices. The observation of electron-hole asymmetry in graphene and recently in twisted graphene and moire heterostructures has spurred interest into whether it stems from single-particle effects or from correlations, which are core to the emergence of intriguing phases in moire systems. Here, we report an effective way to access electron-hole asymmetry in 2D materials by directly measuring the quasiparticle self-energy in graphene/Boron Nitride field-effect devices. As the chemical potential moves from the hole to the electron-doped side, we see an increased strength of electronic correlations manifested by an increase in the band velocity and inverse quasiparticle lifetime. These results suggest that electronic correlations intrinsically drive the electron-hole asymmetry in graphene and by leveraging this asymmetry can provide alternative avenues to generate exotic phases in twisted moire heterostructures.</td>

      <td>Mesostructured matter composed of colloidal nanocrystals in solidified architectures abounds with broadly tunable catalytic, magnetic, optoelectronic, and energy storing properties. Less common are liquid-like assemblies of colloidal nanocrystals in a condensed phase, which may have different energy transduction behaviors owing to their dynamic character. Limiting investigations into dynamic colloidal nanocrystal architectures is the lack of schemes to control or redirect the tendency of the system to solidify. We show how to solidify and subsequently reconfigure colloidal nanocrystal assemblies dimensionally confined to a liquid-liquid interface. Our success in this regard hinged on the development of competitive chemistries anchoring or releasing the nanocrystals to or from the interface. With these chemistries, it was possible to control the kinetic trajectory between quasi-two-dimensional jammed (solid-like) and unjammed (liquid-like) states. In future schemes, it may be possible to leverage this control to direct the formation or destruction of explicit physical pathways for energy carriers to migrate in the system in response to an external field.</td>

      <td>The strong electrostatic interactions at the oil-water interface between a small molecule, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin, H6TPPS, dissolved in water, and an amine terminated hydrophobic polymer dissolved in oil are shown to produce a supramolecular polymer surfactant (SPS) of H6TPPS at the interface with a binding energy that is sufficiently strong to allow an intermolecular aggregation of the supramolecular polymers. SPSs at the oil-water interface are confirmed by in situ real-space atomic force microcopy imaging. The assemblies of these aggregates can jam at the interface, opening a novel route to kinetically trap the liquids in non-equilibrium shapes. The elastic film, comprised of SPSs, wrinkles upon compression, providing a strategy to stabilize liquids in non-equilibrium shapes.</td>

      <td>Although it is generally accepted that structural parameters like width, shape, and edge structure crucially affect the electronic characteristics of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), the exact relationship between geometry and charge transport remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present in situ through-transport measurements of various topological GNRs and GNR heterostructures by lifting the ribbon with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. At the same time, we develop a comprehensive transport model that enables us to understand various features, such as obscuring of localized states in through transport, the effect of topology on transport, as well as negative differential conductance in heterostructures with localized electronic modes. The combined experimental and theoretical efforts described in this paper serve to elucidate general charge transport phenomena in GNRs and GNR heterostructures.</td>

      <td>A flat band structure in momentum space is considered key for the realization of novel phenomena. A topological flat band, also known as a drumhead state, is an ideal platform to drive new exotic topological quantum phases. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments, we reveal the emergence of a highly localized surface state in a topological semimetal BaAl4 and provide its full energy and momentum space topology. We find that the observed surface state is localized in momentum, inside a square-shaped bulk Dirac nodal loop, and in energy, leading to a flat band and a peak in the density of state. These results imply this class of materials as an experimental realization of drumhead surface states and provide an important reference for future studies of the fundamental physics of correlated quantum effects in topological materials.</td>

      <td>Cu metal nanostructures have attracted wide interest of study as catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction and other applications. Controlling the structure and morphology of Cu nanostructures during synthesis is crucial for achieving desired properties. Here, we studied temperature effects on electrochemical deposition of Cu nanoparticles. We found the size, nucleation density, and crystallinity of Cu nanoparticles are strongly influenced by low temperature processing. The electrodeposition at low temperature (-20 degrees C) results in clusters of assembled small Cu nanoparticles, which is distinctly different from the large individual highly crystalline Cu nanoparticles obtained from the room temperature process. The differences in Cu nanoparticle morphology and crystallinity are attributed to the variations in reduction reaction rate and surface diffusion. The limitation of the reaction rate promotes multiple nuclei, and low surface diffusion induce spoor crystallinity. This study deepens our understanding of low-temperature effects on electrochemical processes assisting the design of diverse hierarchical catalytic materials.</td>

      <td>Electrostatic interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and functionalized ligands lead to the formation of NP surfactants (NPSs) that assemble at the water-oil interface and form jammed structures. To understand the interfacial behavior of NPSs, it is necessary to understand the mechanism by which the NPSs attach to the interface and how this attachment depends on the areal coverage of the interface. Through direct observation with high spatial and temporal resolution, using laser scanning confocal microscopy and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), we observe that early-stage attachment of NPs to the interface is diffusion limited and with increasing areal density of the NPSs, further attachment requires cooperative displacement of the previously assembled NPSs both laterally and vertically. The unprecedented detail provided by in situ AFM reveals the complex mechanism of attachment and the deeply nonequilibrium nature of the assembly.</td>

      <td>Locking nonequilibrium shapes of liquids into targeted architectures by interfacial jamming of nanoparticles is an emerging area in material science. 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (H6TPPS) shows three different aggregation states that present an absorption imaging platform to monitor the assembly and jamming of supramolecular polymer surfactants (SPSs) at the liquid/liquid interface. The interfacial interconversion of H6TPPS, specifically H4TPPS2- dissolved in water, from J- to an H-aggregation was induced by strong electrostatic interactions with amine-terminated polystyrene dissolved in toluene at the water/toluene interface. This resulted in color-tunable liquids due to interfacial jamming of the SPSs formed between H4TPPS2- and amine-terminated polystyrene. However, the formed SPSs cannot lock in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids. In addition, a self-wrinkling behavior was observed when amphiphilic triblock copolymers of PS-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) were used to interact with H4TPPS2-. Subsequently, the SPSs formed can lock in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids.</td>

      <td>Natural structural materials featuring fine hierarchical architectures often display remarkable mechanical properties. To inherit the microstructures of biological materials, nickel-plated luffa sponges were fabricated through electrochemical deposition using natural luffa sponges as templates. Four groups of samples were processed based on nickel electroless and electroplating, and then characterized by X-ray diffraction and optical/scanning electron microscopy. Axial compression tests were performed to characterize the mechanical properties of the nickel-plated samples to compare with those of the original natural sponges. Results showed that a uniform layer of nickel was formed on the luffa fibers by electroless plating; conversely, by electroplating the nickel only minimal deposits were found on the inner luffa wall due to the uneven current distribution over the surface of sponge. Accordingly, electroless plating was deemed to be far more effective for metal deposition of materials with complex structures, such as luffa sponge. Alkali treatments prior to plating were found to be critical for subsequent mechanical performance and energy absorption capacity. The mechanical properties of nickel-plated samples surpass those of original luffa sponges, with the enhancement efficiency, i.e., the ratio of specific stiffness and strength, being highest for electroless-plated samples with a prior alkali treatment. Specifically, their energy absorption capacity was far superior to that in other comparable materials. Using a power scaling law, an empirical relationship was derived which indicated that the bending-dominated behavior of the nickel plated luffa sponges was similar to that of open-cell foams. We believe that other artificially bio-inherited materials could be successfully processed and developed in this manner. The superior properties of bio-in-herited materials that we obtained in this work may provide inspiration for future research efforts on bio-inspired structural materials.</td>

      <td>Recent advances in graphene liquid cells for in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have opened many opportunities for the study of materials transformations and chemical reactions in liquids with high spatial resolution. However, the behavior of thin liquids encapsulated in a graphene liquid cell has not been fully understood. Here, we report real rime TEM imaging of the nanoscale dynamic behavior of liquids in graphene nanocapillaries. Our observations reveal that the interfaces between liquid and gas bubble can fluctuate, leading to the generation of liquid nanodroplets near the interfaces. Liquid nanodroplets often show irregular shape with dynamic changes of their configuration under the electron beam. We consider that the dynamic motion of liquid-gas interfaces might be introduced by the electrostatic energy from transiently charged interfaces. We find that improving the wettability of graphene liquid cells by ultraviolet-ozone treatment can significantly modify the dynamic motion of the encapsulated liquids. Our study provides valuable information of the interactions between liquid and graphene under the electron beam, and it also offers key insights on the nanoscale fluid dynamics in confined spaces.</td>

The jamming of the POM-surfactants at the water/oil interface with consequent wrinkling occurs with a decrease in the interfacial area. The packing density of the POM-surfactants at the interface can be tuned by varying the strength of screening with the addition of cations with differing hydrated radii.</td>

      <td>Superconductors can carry very high current densities without resistive loss. This makes them highly suitable for the construction of compact high field magnets of several tens of tesla. However, with increasing current density and magnetic field come high Lorentz loads and high strain levels, and it is empirically known that superconducting properties are affected by strain. The superconducting properties of the most commonly used high field material, Nb3Sn, are particularly badly affected by strain. Here we demonstrate that strain causes significant sub-lattice distortion in the A15 lattice structure of Nb3Sn, and show how this leads to the relatively large reduction of its superconducting properties. The changes are found to be primarily due to changes in the electron density of states, with a lesser contribution due to changes in the phonon spectrum. The amount of sub-lattice distortion further depends on crystal orientation. These findings suggest that it is possible to mitigate the reduction of the current carrying capacity by strain through crystal alignment and sub-lattice stabilization. This would enable superconducting magnets to reach a significantly higher magnetic field, and ease their construction by simplifying react-and-wind coil fabrication.</td>

The permeability of the colloidal membrane can be effectively manipulated by switching the NPSs from a jammed state to an unjammed state with a photo trigger, leading to a controlled molecular diffusion and release, affording a versatile platform for the construction of next generation smart microcapsule systems.</td>

      <td>The assembly and jamming of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) at liquid-liquid interfaces is a versatile platform to endow structured liquid droplets with a magnetization, i.e., producing ferromagnetic liquid droplets (FMLDs). Here, we use hydrodynamics experiments to probe how the magnetization of FMLDs and their response to external stimuli can be tuned by chemical, structural, and magnetic means. The remanent magnetization stems from magnetic NPs jammed at the liquid-liquid interface and dispersed NPs magneto-statically coupled to the interface. FMLDs form even at low concentrations of magnetic NPs when mixing nonmagnetic and magnetic NPs, since the underlying magnetic dipole-driven clustering of magnetic NP-surfactants at the interface produces local magnetic properties, similar to those found with pure magnetic NP solutions. While the net magnetization is smaller, such a clustering of NPs may enable structured liquids with heterogeneous surfaces.</td>

      <td>We consider twisted bilayer graphene on a transition metal dichalcogenide substrate, where proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling significantly alters the eight flat bands which occur near the magic angle. The resulting band structure features a pair of extremely flat bands across most of the mini-Brillouin zone. Further details depend sensitively on the symmetries of the heterostructure; we find semiconducting band structures when all twofold rotations around the in-plane axis are broken, and semimetallic band structures otherwise. We calculate the Chern numbers of the different isolated bands, and identify the parameter regimes and filling factors where valley Chern insulators and topological insulators are realized. Interestingly, we find that for realistic values of the proximity-induced terms, it is possible to realize a topological insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry by doping two holes or two electrons per superlattice unit cell into the system.</td>

      <td>Understanding nanostructure ripening mechanisms is desirable for gaining insight on the growth and potential applications of nanoscale materials. However, the atomic pathways of nanostructure ripening in solution have rarely been observed directly. Here, we report defect-mediated ripening of Cd-CdCl2 core-shell nanoparticles (CSN) revealed by in-situ atomic resolution imaging with liquid cell transmission electron microscopy. We find that ripening is initiated by dissolution of the nanoparticle with an incomplete CdCl2 shell, and that the areas of the Cd core that are exposed to the solution are etched first. The growth of the other nanoparticles is achieved by generating crack defects in the shell, followed by ion diffusion through the cracks. Subsequent healing of crack defects leads to a highly crystalline CSN. The formation and annihilation of crack defects in the CdCl2 shell, accompanied by disordering and crystallization of the shell structure, mediate the ripening of Cd-CdCl2 CSN in the solution. Understanding the ripening of core-shell nanostructures is challenging. Here, the authors use liquid cell transmission electron microscopy to show that the atomic ripening pathway for Cd-CdCl2 core-shell nanoparticles is mediated by crack defects.</td>

      <td>Natural and man-made robotic systems use the interfacial tension between two fluids to support dense objects on liquid surfaces. Here, we show that coacervate-encased droplets of an aqueous polymer solution can be hung from the surface of a less dense aqueous polymer solution using surface tension. The forces acting on and the shapes of the hanging droplets can be controlled. Sacs with homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces are hung from the surface and, by capillary forces, form well-ordered arrays. Locomotion and rotation can be achieved by embedding magnetic microparticles within the assemblies. Direct contact of the droplet with air enables in situ manipulation and compartmentalized cascading chemical reactions with selective transport. Applications including functional microreactors, motors, and biomimetic robots are evident.</td>

      <td>Time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (trARPES) is a powerful method to track the ultrafast dynamics of quasiparticles and electronic bands in energy and momentum space. We present a setup for trARPES with 22.3 eV extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) femtosecond pulses at 50-kHz repetition rate, which enables fast data acquisition and access to dynamics across momentum space with high sensitivity. The design and operation of the XUV beamline, pump-probe setup, and ultra-high vacuum endstation are described in detail. By characterizing the effect of space-charge broadening, we determine an ultimate source-limited energy resolution of 60 meV, with typically 80-100 meV obtained at 1-2 x 10(10) photons/s probe flux on the sample. The instrument capabilities are demonstrated via both equilibrium and time-resolved ARPES studies of transition-metal dichalcogenides. The 50-kHz repetition rate enables sensitive measurements of quasiparticles at low excitation fluences in semiconducting MoSe2, with an instrumental time resolution of 65 fs. Moreover, photo-induced phase transitions can be driven with the available pump fluence, as shown by charge density wave melting in 1T-TiSe2. The high repetition-rate setup thus provides a versatile platform for sensitive XUV trARPES, from quenching of electronic phases down to the perturbative limit.

      <td>The structure and energy of grain boundaries (GBs) are essential for predicting the properties of polycrystalline materials. In this work, we use high-throughput density functional theory calculations workflow to construct the Grain Boundary Database (GBDB), the largest database of DFT-computed grain boundary properties to date. The database currently encompasses 327 GBs of 58 elemental metals, including 10 common twist or symmetric tilt GBs for body-centered cubic (bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) systems and the Sigma 7 [0001] twist GB for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) systems. In particular, we demonstrate a novel scaled-structural template approach for HT GB calculations, which reduces the computational cost of converging GB structures by a factor of similar to 3-6. The grain boundary energies and work of separation are rigorously validated against previous experimental and computational data. Using this large GB dataset, we develop an improved predictive model for the GB energy of different elements based on the cohesive energy and shear modulus. The open GBDB represents a significant step forward in the availability of first principles GB properties, which we believe would help guide the future design of polycrystalline materials.

      <td>We investigate using local structural disorder to induce a topologically nontrivial phase in a solid state system. Using first-principles calculations, we introduce structural disorder in the trivial insulator BiTeI and observe the emergence of a topological insulating phase. By modifying the bonding environments, the crystal-field splitting is enhanced, with spin-orbit interactions producing a band inversion in the bulk electronic structure. Analysis of the Wannier charge centers and the surface electronic structure reveals a strong topological insulator with Dirac surface states. Finally, we propose a prescription for inducing topological states from disorder in crystalline materials. Understanding how local environments produce topological phases is a key step for predicting disordered and amorphous topological materials.</td>

      <td>High-entropy alloys are an intriguing new class of metallic materials that derive their properties from being multi-element systems that can crystallize as a single phase, despite containing high concentrations of five or more elements with different crystal structures. Here we examine an equiatomic medium-entropy alloy containing only three elements, CrCoNi, as a single-phase face-centred cubic solid solution, which displays strength-toughness properties that exceed those of all high-entropy alloys and most multi-phase alloys. At room temperature, the alloy shows tensile strengths of almost 1 GPa, failure strains of similar to 70% and K-JIc fracture-toughness values above 200 MPa m(1/2); at cryogenic temperatures strength, ductility and toughness of the CrCoNi alloy improve to strength levels above 1.3 GPa, failure strains up to 90% and K-JIc values of 275 MPa m(1/2). Such properties appear to result from continuous steady strain hardening, which acts to suppress plastic instability, resulting from pronounced dislocation activity and deformation-induced nano-twinning.</td>

      <td>Amine-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), the smallest, monodisperse cage-shaped silica cubic nanoparticle, is exceptionally interfacially active and can form assemblies that jam the toluene/water interface, locking in non-equilibrium shapes of one liquid phase in another. The packing density of the amine-functionalized POSS assembly at the water/toluene interface can be tuned by varying the concentration, the pH value, and the degree of POSS functionalization. Functionalized POSS gives a higher interface coverage, and hence a lower interfacial tension, than nanoparticle surfactants formed by interactions between functionalized nanoparticles and polymeric ligands. Hydrogen-bonded POSS surfactants are more stable at the interface, offering some unique advantages for generating Pickering emulsions over typical micron-sized colloidal particles and ligand-stabilized nanoparticle surfactants.</td>

      <td>High-entropy alloys (HEAs), also known as multi-principal element alloys or multi-component alloys, have been the subject of numerous investigations since they were first described in 2004. The earliest HEA was the equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi Cantor alloy, but HEM now encompass a broad class of metallic and ceramic systems. The concept of utilizing the high entropy of mixing to develop stable multi-element alloys may not be scientifically correct but has produced extraordinary mechanical properties in specific HEAs, mainly CrCoNi-based alloys, associated with their continuous work-hardening rate that is sustained to large plastic strains (similar to 0.5) and at low temperatures. This, in combination with the high frictional forces on dislocations and a propensity for twinning, leads to outstandingly high fracture toughness values (exceeding 200 MPa.m(1/2)) and resistance to shear-band formation under dynamic loading. The critical shear strain for the onset of adiabatic shear band formation is similar to 7 for the Cantor alloy, much higher than that for conventional alloys, suggesting superior ballistic properties. The slower diffusion rates resulting from the multi-element environment contribute to the excellent intermediate temperature performance. We review the principal mechanical properties of these alloys with emphasis on the face-centered cubic systems, such as the CrCoNi-based alloys. Their favorable mechanical properties and ease of processing by conventional means suggest extensive utilization in many future structural applications.</td>

      <td>Enzyme immobilization in the confines of microfluidic chips, that promote enzyme activity and stability, has become a powerful strategy to enhance biocatalysis and biomass conversion. Here, based on a newly developed all-liquid microfluidic chip, fabricated by the interfacial assembly of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) in a biphasic system, a layer-by-layer assembly strategy to generate polysaccharide multilayers on the surface of a microchannel, greatly enhancing the mechanical properties of the microchannel and offering a biocompatible microenvironment for enzyme immobilization, is presented. Using horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase as model enzymes, all-liquid microfluidic enzymatic and cascade reactors have been constructed and the crucial role of polysaccharide multilayers on enhancing the enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency is demonstrated.</td>

      <td>The presence, nature, and impact of chemical short-range order in the multi-principal element alloy CrCoNi are all topics of current interest and debate. First-principles calculations reveal that its origins are fundamentally magnetic, involving repulsion between like-spin Co-Cr and Cr-Cr pairs that is complemented by the formation of a magnetically aligned sublattice of second-nearest-neighbor Cr atoms. Ordering models following these principles are found to predict otherwise anomalous experimental measurements concerning both magnetization and atomic volumes across a range of compositions. In addition to demonstrating the impact of magnetic interactions and resulting chemical rearrangement, the possible explanation of experiments would imply that short-range order of this type is far more prevalent than previously realized.</td>

      <td>The formations of charge and lattice orders are generally coupled in charge density wave (CDW) materials and share identical order wave vectors. Although this situation is usually satisfied in a large class of two-dimensional materials, it falls short in describing the so-called CDW-like phase transition in layered tantalum ditelluride (TaTe2), accompanied by anomalous low temperature transport properties and a periodic lattice distortion (PLD). Here we combine angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction to directly access the charge and lattice structures in 1T-polytypic TaTe2 and study the anomalous phase transition. Our data reveal the presence of a surprising quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface with nesting (FSN) condition, despite its van der Waals layered structure. We find that the wave vectors of the FSN and PLD are different, suggesting the decoupled formation between charge and lattice orders. These conditions are accompanied by rich footprints in band structure, including Fermi surface suppression, minigaps, and satellite bands. Our results suggest that TaTe2 manifests intrinsic mixed dimensionality between its electronic and lattice structure and that the CDW-like phase transition is likely governed by multiple mechanisms. Our work provides routes for forging unconventional CDW phases and charge-lattice entanglement that would otherwise not be available in materials with fixed dimensionality.</td>

      <td>Two dimensional inorganic-organic hybrid perovskites (2D perovskites) suffer from not only quantum confinement, but also dielectric confinement, hindering their application perspective in devices involving the conversion of an optical input into current. In this report, we theoretically predict that an extremely low exciton binding energy can be achieved in 2D perovskites by using high dielectric-constant organic components. We demonstrate that in (HOCH2CH2NH3)(2)Pbl(4), whose organic material has a high dielectric constant of 37, the dielectric confinement is largely reduced, and the exciton binding energy is 20-times smaller than that in conventional 2D perovskites. As a result, the photo-induced excitons can be thermally dissociated efficiently at room temperature, as clearly indicated from femtosecond transient absorption measurements. In addition, the mobility is largely improved due to the strong screening effect on charge impurities. Such low dielectric-confined 2D perovskites show excellent carrier extraction efficiency, and outstanding humidity resistance compared to conventional 2D perovskites.</td>

      <td>A hallmark of biological systems is the ability to compartmentalize and coordinate system functions, which has been a challenge even in the most sophisticated synthetic mimics. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to fabricate compartmentalized systems in 3D water-in-water constructs stabilized by an elastic polyanion-polycation coacervate membrane. Using a 3D printer, the length, shape, and diameter of all-aqueous tubules are broadly controlled. We demonstrate directional diffusion of ionic species across the membrane dictated by the preferential affinity of the polyelectrolyte in the oppositely charged phase. In conjunction with microfluidic techniques, continuous selective diffusion and compartmentalized reactions are demonstrated in such all-aqueous systems. A layer-by-layer strategy is also used to tune the membrane's mechanical properties and to functionalize them. Such a new platform is demonstrated for developing and manipulating continuous separations media or compartmentalized reactive systems that function independently or can be coupled with selective diffusion across the membrane.</td>

      <td>AgCl is photosensitive and thus often used as micromotors. However, the dynamics of individual AgCl nanoparticle motion in liquids upon illumination remains elusive. Here, using liquid cell transmission electron microscope (TEM), AgCl nanocrystals reshaping and splitting spontaneously in an aqueous solution under electron beam illumination are observed. It is found that the AgCl nanocrystals are negatively charged in the liquid environment, where the charge induces a repulsive Coulomb force that reshapes and stretches those nanocrystals. Upon extensive stretching, the AgCl nanocrystal splits into small nanocrystals and each nanocrystal retracts back into cuboid shapes due to the cohesive surface. This analysis shows that each nanocrystal maintains a single crystal rocksalt structure during splitting. The splitting of AgCl nanocrystals is analogous to the electrified liquid droplets or other reported the Coulomb fission phenomenon, but with distinctive structural properties. Revealing of the dynamic behavior of AgCl nanocrystals opens the opportunity to explore their potential applications as actuators for nanodevices.</td>

      <td>Many macroscopic properties such as collective chiral responses enhanced by coupled plasmonic nanoparticles require complex nanostructures. However, a key challenge is to directly assemble nanosized building blocks into functional entities with designed morphologies. For example, the DNA templated nanoparticle assembly has low scalability and requires aqueous conditions, while other approaches such as controlled drying and polymer templating access only simple 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D structures with limited assembly patterns. Here, we demonstrate a new self-assembly strategy that expands the diversity of 3-D nanoparticle assemblies. By subjecting supramolecular nanocomposites to cylindrical confinement, a range of new nanoparticle assemblies such as stacked rings and single and double helices can be readily obtained with a precisely defined morphology. Circular dichroism dark field scattering measurements on the single nanowire with Au helical ribbon-like assembly show chiral plasmonic response several orders of magnitude higher than that of natural chiral materials. The phase behavior of supramolecular nanocomposite under geometric constraints is quite different from that of block copolymer. It depends on the complex interplay among nanoparticle packing and phase behavior of parent block copolymers under confinement and can be governed by nanoparticle diffusion.</td>

Here we develop a covalently modified polyoxometalate/beta-cyclodextrin (POM/beta-CD) organic-inorganic hybrid, consisting of a negatively charged POM cluster with beta-CD host groups. The POM/beta-CD hybrid can be dispersed in water and interacts at a water/oil interface with ligands dissolved in an oil phase through electrostatic or host-guest interactions, thereby generating POM-surfactants (POMSs) having pH, redox, and guest-competitive responsiveness, respectively. By taking advantage of the jamming of POMSs at the interface, a reconfigurable all-liquid system could be produced that is responsive to orthogonal changes in the external environment.</td>

      <td>GRAPHENE OXIDE</td>
      <td>2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), a class of emerging nanomaterials with intriguing properties, have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, owing to the highly hydrophilic nature of MXene nanosheets, assembly strategies of MXene at liquid-liquid interfaces have been very limited and challenging. Herein, through the cooperative assembly of MXene and amine-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane at the oil-water interface, we report the formation, assembly, and jamming of a new type MXene-based Janus-like nanoparticle surfactants, termed MXene-surfactants (MXSs), which can significantly enhance the interfacial activity of MXene nanosheets. More importantly, this simple assembly strategy opens a new platform for the fabrication of functional MXene assemblies from mesoscale (e.g., structured liquids) to macroscale (e.g., aerogels), that can be used for a range of applications, including nanocomposites, electronic devices, and all-liquid microfluidic devices.</td>

      <td>Two dimensional (2D) materials have found various applications because of their unique physical properties. For example, graphene has been used as the electron transparent membrane for liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM) due to its high mechanical strength and flexibility, single-atom thickness, chemical inertness, etc. Here, we report using 2D MoS2 as a functional substrate as well as the membrane window for liquid cell TEM, which is enabled by our facile and polymer-free MoS2 transfer process. This provides the opportunity to investigate the growth of Pt nanocrystals on MoS2 substrates, which elucidates the formation mechanisms of such heterostructured 2D materials. We find that Pt nanocrystals formed in MoS2 liquid cells have a strong tendency to align their crystal lattice with that of MoS2, suggesting a van der Waals epitaxial relationship. Importantly, we can study its impact on the kinetics of the nanocrystal formation. The development of MoS2 liquid cells will allow further study of various liquid phenomena on MoS2, and the polymer-free MoS2 transfer process will be implemented in a wide range of applications.</td>

      <td>In this work, we demonstrate a method to quantify uncertainty in corrections to density functional theory (DFT) energies based on empirical results. Such corrections are commonly used to improve the accuracy of computational enthalpies of formation, phase stability predictions, and other energy-derived properties, for example. We incorporate this method into a new DFT energy correction scheme comprising a mixture of oxidation-state and composition-dependent corrections and show that many chemical systems contain unstable polymorphs that may actually be predicted stable when uncertainty is taken into account. We then illustrate how these uncertainties can be used to estimate the probability that a compound is stable on a compositional phase diagram, thus enabling better-informed assessments of compound stability.</td>

      <td>We introduce a graphene-based nanofluidic cell that facilitates in situ imaging of liquid samples via transmission electron microscopy. The cell combines the benefits of graphene liquid cells-namely, high resolution, reduced charging effects, and excellent sample stability-with the ability to introduce reactants and control fluid concentrations as provided by conventional silicon-nitride-windowed flow cells. The graphene flow cell offers significantly less window bowing compared to existing commercial holders. We demonstrate the performance of the flow cell by imaging gold nanoparticle dynamics and uranyl acetate crystallization. Our results confirm the utility of graphene flow cells in obtaining the high spatial and temporal resolution required for probing the complex dynamics of nanoparticles and nucleation pathways in aqueous solutions.</td>

      <td>The assembly and binding of nanoparticles at the interfaces of aqueous two-phase systems enable the three-dimensional (3D) printing of all-aqueous naturally occurring materials. When a dispersion of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) in an aqueous solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) is brought into contact with chitosan dissolved in an aqueous solution of dextran, the CNCs and chitosan diffuse to the interface between the two immiscible aqueous solutions, electrostatically interact, and form a solid, membranous layer sufficiently rapidly to 3D print tubules of one liquid in the other. The diameter, length, spatial arrangement, and stability of the printed tubules can be broadly controlled. Adsorption and directional diffusion of ionic species across the membranous layer make heavy metal ion removal possible. The results present a platform for fabricating and developing all-aqueous compartmentalized systems where function can be independently coupled to the inherent functionality of the nanoparticles or ligands.</td>

      <td>Blends of nanoparticles, polymers, and small molecules can self-assemble into optical, magnetic, and electronic devices with structure-dependent properties. However, the relationship between a multicomponent nanocomposite's formulation and its assembled structure is complex and cannot be predicted by theory. The blends can be strongly influenced by processing conditions, which can introduce non-equilibrium states. Currently, nanocomposite devices are designed through cycles of experimental trial and error. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative because they can use existing datasets to map high-dimensional spaces. These methods do not rely on known relationships between parameters, so they are suited to complex systems without a solid theoretical foundation. Here, a dataset of 595 microscopy images of nanocomposite thin films is used to train a series of ML models. Correlations between the input and output parameters are examined, providing new insights into the system. Finally, the most successful ML model is used to predict the structures of new nanocomposite compositions. The results confirm that ML techniques can be used to improve the efficiency of nanocomposite device design. More broadly, the current study suggests some of the advantages and challenges associated with applying ML to complex systems.</td>

      <td>The sky is a natural heat sink that has been extensively used for passive radiative cooling of households. A lot of focus has been on maximizing the radiative cooling power of roof coating in the hot daytime using static, cooling-optimized material properties. However, the resultant overcooling in cold night or winter times exacerbates the heating cost, especially in climates where heating dominates energy consumption. We approached thermal regulation from an all-season perspective by developing a mechanically flexible coating that adapts its thermal emittance to different ambient temperatures. The fabricated temperature-adaptive radiative coating (TARC) optimally absorbs the solar energy and automatically switches thermal emittance from 0.20 for ambient temperatures lower than 15 degrees C to 0.90 for temperatures above 30 degrees C, driven by a photonically amplified metal-insulator transition. Simulations show that this system outperforms existing roof coatings for energy saving in most climates, especially those with substantial seasonal variations.</td>

      <td>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for obtaining precise information about the local bonding of materials, but difficult to interpret without a well-vetted dataset of reference spectra. The ability to predict NMR parameters and connect them to three-dimensional local environments is critical for understanding more complex, long-range interactions. New computational methods have revealed structural information available from Si-29 solid-state NMR by generating computed reference spectra for solids. Such predictions are useful for the identification of new silicon-containing compounds, and serve as a starting point for determination of the local environments present in amorphous structures. In this study, we have used 42 silicon sites as a benchmarking set to compare experimentally reported Si-29 solid-state NMR spectra with those computed by CASTEP-NMR and Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Program (VASP). Data-driven approaches enable us to identify the source of discrepancies across a range of experimental and computational results. The information from NMR (in the form of an NMR tensor) has been validated, and in some cases corrected, in an effort to catalog these for the local spectroscopy database infrastructure (LSDI), where over 10,000 Si-29 NMR tensors for crystalline materials have been computed. Knowledge of specific tensor values can serve as the basis for executing NMR experiments with precision, optimizing conditions to capture the elements accurately. The ability to predict and compare experimental observables from a wide range of structures can aid researchers in their chemical assignments and structure determination, since the computed values enables the extension beyond tables of typical chemical shift (or shielding) ranges.</td>

      <td>The electronic transport behaviour of materials determines their suitability for technological applications. We develop a computationally efficient method for calculating carrier scattering rates of solid-state semiconductors and insulators from first principles inputs. The present method extends existing polar and non-polar electron-phonon coupling, ionized impurity, and piezoelectric scattering mechanisms formulated for isotropic band structures to support highly anisotropic materials. We test the formalism by calculating the electronic transport properties of 23 semiconductors, including the large 48 atom CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid perovskite, and comparing the results against experimental measurements and more detailed scattering simulations. The Spearman rank coefficient of mobility against experiment (r(s)=0.93) improves significantly on results obtained using a constant relaxation time approximation (r(s)=0.52). We find our approach offers similar accuracy to state-of-the art methods at approximately 1/500th the computational cost, thus enabling its use in high-throughput computational workflows for the accurate screening of carrier mobilities, lifetimes, and thermoelectric power. It is difficult to compute the transport properties of a broad array of complex materials both accurately and inexpensively. Here, the authors develop a computationally efficient method for calculating carrier scattering rates of semiconductors, with good accuracy but low cost.</td>

      <td>Using the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and polymeric ligands to generate nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the liquid-liquid interface, the binding energy of the NP to the interface can be significantly increased, irreversibly binding the NPSs to the interface. By designing a simplified NPS model, where the NP size can be precisely controlled and the characteristic fluorescence of the NPs be used as a direct probe of their spatial distribution, we provide new insights into the attachment mechanism of NPSs at the liquid-liquid interface. We find that the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be reduced by competitive ligands, resulting in the dissociation and disassembly of NPSs at the interface, and allowing the construction of responsive, reconfigurable all-liquid systems. Smaller NPSs that are loosely packed (unjammed) and irreversibly bound to the interface can be displaced by larger NPSs, giving rise to a size-dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface. However, when the smaller size NPSs are densely packed and jam at the interface, the size-dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface can be completely suppressed.</td>

      <td>Nonequilibrium structures in nanocomposites provide possibilities to modulate the organization of nanofillers beyond the phase diagram and to fabricate functional materials with targeted properties. However, multicomponent systems, such as nanocomposites, have complex phase diagrams and kinetic pathways. Here, effects of two critical parameters, nanoparticle (NP) size and supramolecular morphology, were systematically evaluated in NP/supramolecule blends. NPs in the size range of 5-25 nm were assembled in cylindrical or lamellar supramolecular nanocomposite thin films with periodicities of 20-30 nm under solvent vapor annealing and rapid solvent removal conditions. The ratio of particle size to supramolecular periodicity was tuned between 0.17 and 1.25. The results showed that the vertical diffusion of NPs toward the film surface depends on the matrix morphology. NP surface migration is more prominent in cylindrical thin films than in lamellar thin films. This is mainly attributed to the higher energetic barriers for interdomain diffusion in lamellar morphology. Supramolecular nancomposite thin films with ordered structures can be obtained by balancing the size-dependent NP diffusivity and energetic factors affecting NP diffusion during the annealing process for a range of NP sizes. Present studies give insight into how to manipulate the assembly kinetics to access targeted morphologies in nanocomposite thin films.</td>

      <td>Topological solitary fields, such as magnetic and polar skyrmions, are envisioned to revolutionize microelectronics. These configurations have been stabilized in solid-state materials with a global inversion symmetry breaking, which translates in magnetic materials into a vector spin exchange known as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), as well as spin chirality selection and isotropic solitons. This work reports experimental evidence of 3D chiral spin textures, such as helical spins and skyrmions with different chirality and topological charge, stabilized in amorphous Fe-Ge thick films. These results demonstrate that structurally and chemically disordered materials with a random DMI can resemble inversion symmetry broken systems with similar magnetic properties, moments, and states. Disordered systems are distinguished from systems with global inversion symmetry breaking by their degenerate spin chirality that allows for forming isotropic and anisotropic topological spin textures at remanence, while offering greater flexibility in materials synthesis, voltage, and strain manipulation.</td>

      <td>The direct 3D printing of ultralight architectures with ultralow-concentration 2D nanomaterial inks is necessary yet challenging. Here, we describe an emulsion-based ink for direct printing using 2D nanomaterials, i.e., MXene and graphene oxide (GO). The electrostatic interactions between the ligands in the oil phase and the 2D nanomaterials in the aqueous phase help form sheet-like surfactants at the interface. The interactions between the anchored ligands among different droplets dictate the rheological characteristics of inks, enabling a gel-like behavior ideally suitable for 3D printing at ultralow concentrations of 2D nanomaterials. The 3D printed foams possess lightweight structures with densities of 2.8 mg cm-3 (GO-based) and 4.1 mg cm-3 (MXene-based), and the latter integrates outstanding electrical conductivity, electromagnetic shielding performance, and thermal insulation comparable to air. This work describes a general approach for direct-printing ultralight porous structures that take advantage of the inherent properties of 2D building blocks.</td>

      <td>Using amphiphilic molecular brushes to stabilize emulsions usually requires the synthesis of specific side chains, which can be a time-consuming and difficult challenge to meet. By taking advantage of the electrostatic interactions between water-soluble molecular brushes and oil-soluble oligomeric ligands, the in situ formation, assembly and jamming of molecular brush surfactants (MBSs) at the oil-water interface is described. With MBSs, stable emulsions including o/w, w/o and o/w/o can be easily prepared by varying the molar ratios of the molecular brushes to the ligands. Moreover, when jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, i.e., structuring liquids, producing an elastic film at the interface with exceptional mechanical properties. These structured liquids have numerous potential applications, including chemical biphasic reactions, liquid electronics, and all-liquid biomimetic system.</td>

      <td>Block copolymer (BCP)-based supramolecules offer a versatile platform to generate hierarchically assembled nanostructures with inherent functions. However, the multicomponent supramolecular system is complex, and there is a limited understanding of the self-assembly process which is critical for precise control of the nanostructure. Here, the effect of small molecule loading and the solvent annealing condition on thin films of supramolecules on flat and patterned substrates were investigated. There is a superposition between the effect of the small molecule loading and solvent annealing condition that can be used to control the assembly rate, grain size, and feature size. The final film features are a result of the kinetic pathway taken during the assembly process. On patterned substrates with linear or circular trenches, the assembly is not driven by incommensurability as is commonly seen in BCP thin films but rather by the kinetic pathway. The present study offers insight into the importance of systematic studies in the kinetic process in self-assembly of multicomponent systems.</td>

      <td>Water-walking insects can harness capillary forces by changing their body posture to climb or descend the meniscus between the surface of water and a solid object. Controlling surface tension in this manner is necessary for predation, escape and survival. Inspired by this behaviour, we demonstrate autonomous, aqueous-based synthetic systems that overcome the meniscus barrier and shuttle cargo subsurface to and from a landing site and a targeted drop-off site. We change the sign of the contact angle of a coacervate sac containing an aqueous phase or of a hydrogel droplet hanging from the surface by controlling the normal force acting on the sac or droplet. The cyclic buoyancy-induced cargo shuttling occurs continuously, as long as the supply of reactants diffusing to the sac or droplet from the surrounding aqueous phase is not exhausted. These findings may lead to potential applications in autonomously driven reaction or delivery systems and micro-/milli-robotics.</td>

      <td>Currently available conductive inks present a challenge to achieving electrical performance without compromising mechanical properties, scalability, and processability. Here, we have developed blends of carbon black and the commercially available triblock copolymer (BCP), polystyrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene)-g-maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MAH) (FG1924G, Kraton), that can be readily applied as a conductive coating via a spray-coating process, for a wide range of insulating materials (fabric, wood, glass, and plastic). Simple but effective mechanical and chemical modifications of the ingredients can increase the electrical conductivity (similar to 100 S/m) by an order of magnitude more than previously reported for carbon black composites; moreover, the coatings display excellent mechanical flexibility (tensile strain epsilon similar to 5.00 mm/mm). To correlate electrical conductivity and nanoscale structural changes with mechanical deformation, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) during in situ tensile testing was performed. We show that the nanocomposite can be produced using low-cost ingredients (similar to$ 10/kg), ensuring scalability for fabrication of large-scale devices without specialized material synthesis. Equally important, the phase behavior of block copolymers can enable recovery from physical damage via thermal annealing, which is critical for product longevity.</td>

      <td>Soft polymeric Janus nanoparticles (JNPs), made from polystyrene-b-poly(butadiene)-b-poly(methylmethacrylate), PS-PB-PMMA, triblock terpolymers, assemble into a monolayer at the water-oil interface to reduce interfacial tension. The extent to which the polymer chains can deform influences the packing density of the JNPs at the interface. The longer the polymer chains are relative to the core, the softer are the JNPs, resulting in a JNPs assembly with a lower initial lateral packing density. The interfacial activity of JNPs can be further tuned by complexation of the PMMA chains with lithium ions that are introduced into the water phase. This work provides a fundamental understanding of soft JNPs packing at the water-oil interface and provides a strategy to tailor the areal density of soft JNPs at liquid-liquid interface, enabling the design of smart responsive structured-liquid systems.</td>

      <td>The binary Ta-N chemical system includes several compounds with notable prospects in microelectronics, solar energy harvesting, and catalysis. Among these, metallic TaN and semiconducting Ta3N5 have garnered significant interest, in part due to their synthetic accessibility. However, tantalum sesquinitride (Ta2N3) possesses an intermediate composition and largely unknown physical properties owing to its metastable nature. Herein, Ta2N3 is directly deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering and its optoelectronic properties are characterized. Combining these results with density functional theory provides insights into the critical role of oxygen in both synthesis and electronic structure. While the inclusion of oxygen in the process gas is critical to Ta2N3 formation, the resulting oxygen incorporation in structural vacancies drastically modifies the free electron concentration in the as-grown material, thus leading to a semiconducting character with a 1.9 eV bandgap. Reducing the oxygen impurity concentration via post-synthetic ammonia annealing increases the conductivity by seven orders of magnitude and yields the metallic characteristics of a degenerate semiconductor, consistent with theoretical predictions. Thus, this inverse oxygen doping approach - by which the carrier concentration is reduced by the oxygen impurity - offers a unique opportunity to tailor the optoelectronic properties of Ta2N3 for applications ranging from photochemical energy conversion to advanced photonics.</td>

      <td>Liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enables the direct observation of dynamic physical and chemical processes in liquids at the nanoscale. Quantitative investigations into reactions with fast kinetics and/or multiple reagents will benefit from further advances in liquid cell design that facilitate rapidin situmixing and precise control over reagent volumes and concentrations. This work reports the development of inorganic-organic nanocapsules for high-resolution TEM imaging of nanoscale reactions in liquids with well-defined zeptoliter volumes. These hybrid nanocapsules, with 48 nm average diameter, consist of a thin layer of gold coating a lipid vesicle. As a model reaction, the nucleation, growth, and diffusion of nanobubbles generated by the radiolysis of water is investigated inside the nanocapsules. When the nanobubbles are sufficiently small (10-25 nm diameter), they are mobile in the nanocapsules, but their movement deviates from Brownian motion, which may result from geometric confinement by the nanocapsules. Gases and fluids can be transported between two nanocapsules when they fuse, demonstratingin situmixing without using complex microfluidic schemes. The ability to synthesize nanocapsules with controlled sizes and to monitor dynamics simultaneously inside multiple nanocapsules provides opportunities to investigate nanoscale processes such as single nanoparticle synthesis in confined volumes and biological processes such as biomineralization and membrane dynamics.</td>

      <td>The relaxation and aging of an assembly of spherical nanoparticles (NPs) at a water-oil interface are characterized in situ by grazing incidence X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. The dynamics of the interfacial assembly is measured while the interface saturates with NPs. Weak attractions between NPs lead to gel-like structures in the assembly, where the in-plane ordering is inhibited by the broad size distribution of the NPs. Structural rearrangements on the length scale of the NP-NP center-to-center distances proceed by intermittent fluctuations instead of continuous cooperative motions. The coexistence of rapid and slow NP populations is confirmed, as commonly observed in soft glass-forming materials. Dynamics are increasingly slowed as the NPs initially segregate to the locally clustered interface. The structural relaxation of the NPs in these localized clusters is 5 orders of magnitude slower than that of free particles in the bulk. When the interface is nearly saturated, the time for relaxation increases suddenly due to the onset of local jamming, and the dynamics slow exponentially afterward until the system reaches collective jamming by cooperative rearrangements. This investigation provides insights into structural relaxations near the glass transition and the evolution of the structure and dynamics of the assemblies as they transition from an isotropic liquid to a dense disordered film.</td>

      <td>Photoelectrocatalysts that use sunlight to power the CO2 reduction reaction will be crucial for carbon-neutral power and energy-efficient industrial processes. Scalable photoelectrocatalysts must satisfy a stringent set of criteria, such as stability under operating conditions, product selectivity, and efficient light absorption. Two-dimensional materials can offer high specific surface area, tunability, and potential for heterostructuring, providing a fresh landscape of candidate catalysts. From a set of promising bulk CO2 reduction photoelectrocatalysts, we screen for candidate monolayers of these materials, then study their catalytic feasibility and suitability. For stable monolayer candidates, we verify the presence of visible-light band gaps, check that band edges can support CO2 reduction, determine exciton binding energies, and compute surface reactivity. We find visible light absorption for SiAs, ZnTe, and ZnSe monolayers, and that due to a lack of binding, CO selectivity is possible. We thus identify SiAs, ZnTe, and ZnSe monolayers as targets for further investigation, expanding the chemical space for CO2 photoreduction candidates.</td>

      <td>Computing the GW quasiparticle band structure and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) absorption spectra for materials with spin-orbit coupling have commonly been done by treating GW corrections and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as separate perturbations to density-functional theory. However, accurate treatment of materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (such as many topological materials of recent interest, and thermoelectrics) often requires a nonperturbative approach using spinor wave functions in the Kohn-Sham equation and GW/BSE. Such calculations have only recently become available, in particular for the BSE. We have implemented this approach in the plane-wave pseudopotential GW/BSE code BerkeleyGW, which is highly parallelized and widely used in the electronic-structure community. We present reference results for quasiparticle band structures and optical absorption spectra of solids with different strengths of spin-orbit coupling, including Si, Ge, GaAs, GaSb, CdSe, Au, and Bi2Se3. The calculated quasiparticle band gaps of these systems are found to agree with experiment to within a few tens of meV. SOC splittings are found to be generally in better agreement with experiment, including quasiparticle corrections to band energies. The absorption spectrum of GaAs is not significantly impacted by the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling due to its relatively small value (0.2 eV) in the Lambda direction, while the absorption spectrum of GaSb calculated with the spinor GW/BSE captures the large spin-orbit splitting of peaks in the spectrum. For the prototypical topological insulator Bi2Se3, we find a drastic change in the low-energy band structure compared to that of DFT, with the spinorial treatment of the GW approximation correctly capturing the parabolic nature of the valence and conduction bands after including off-diagonal self-energy matrix elements. We present the detailed methodology, approach to spatial symmetries for spinors, comparison against other codes, and performance compared to spinless GW/BSE calculations and perturbative approaches to SOC. This work aims to spur further development of spinor GW/BSE methodology in excited-state research software and enables a more accurate and detailed exploration of electronic and optical properties of materials containing elements with large atomic numbers.</td>

      <td>Harnessing the self-organization of soft materials to make complex, well-ordered surface patterns in a noninvasive manner is challenging. The wrinkling of thin films provides a compelling strategy to achieve this. Despite much attention, however, a simple, single-step, reversible method that gives rise to controlled, two-dimensional (2D) ordered, continuous, and discontinuous patterns has proven to be elusive. Here a novel, robust method is described to achieve this using an ultraviolet-light-sensitive anthracene-containing polymer thin film. The origin of the patterns is the local buckling of the thin film, where the control over the topology is given by laterally patterning out-of-plane gradients in the crosslink density of the film. The underlying buckling mechanics and formation of the surface features are well-described by finite element analysis. By illuminating the film with a photomask, local and long-range patterns that can be both continuous and discontinuous are able to be written. Furthermore, the patterning is fully reversible over multiple cycles. The results demonstrate a simple strategy for erasable storage of information in a surface topography that has applications in memory, anticounterfeiting, and plasmonics.</td>

      <td>Computational materials discovery efforts are enabled by large databases of properties derived from high-throughput density functional theory (DFT), which now contain millions of calculations at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level of theory. It is now feasible to carry out high-throughput calculations using more accurate methods, such as meta-GGA DFT; however recomputing an entire database with a higher-fidelity method would not effectively leverage the enormous investment of computational resources embodied in existing (GGA) calculations. Instead, we propose here a general procedure by which higher-fidelity, low-coverage calculations (e.g., meta-GGA calculations for selected chemical systems) can be combined with lower-fidelity, high-coverage calculations (e.g., an existing database of GGA calculations) in a robust and scalable manner. We then use legacy PBE(+U) GGA calculations and new r(2)SCAN meta-GGA calculations from the Materials Project database to demonstrate that our scheme improves solid and aqueous phase stability predictions, and discuss practical considerations for its implementation.</td>

      <td>Cation exchange (CE) has been recognized as a particularly powerful tool for the synthesis of heterogeneous nanocrystals. At present, CE can be divided into two categories, namely ion solvation-driven CE reaction and thermally activated CE reaction. Here we report an electrically driven CE reaction to prepare individual nanostructures inside a transmission electron microscope. During the process, Cd is eliminated due to Ohmic heating, whereas Cu+ migrates into the crystal driven by the electrical field force. Contrast experiments reveal that the feasibility of electrically driven CE is determined by the structural similarity of the sulfur sublattices between the initial and final phases, and the standard electrode potentials of the active electrodes. Our experimental results demonstrate a strategy for the selective growth of individual nanocrystals and provide crucial insights into understanding of the microscopic pathways leading to the formation of heterogeneous structures.</td>

      <td>Developing ultrahigh-strength steels that are ductile, fracture resistant, and cost effective would be attractive for a variety of structural applications. We show that improved fracture resistance in a steel with an ultrahigh yield strength of nearly 2 gigapascals can be achieved by activating delamination toughening coupled with transformation-induced plasticity. Delamination toughening associated with intensive but controlled cracking at manganese-enriched prior-austenite grain boundaries normal to the primary fracture surface dramatically improves the overall fracture resistance. As a result, fracture under plane-strain conditions is automatically transformed into a series of fracture processes in parallel plane-stress conditions through the thickness. The present high-strength induced multidelamination strategy offers a different pathway to develop engineering materials with ultrahigh strength and superior toughness at economical materials cost.</td>

      <td>Extensive prior work has shown that colloidal inorganic nanocrystals coated with organic ligand shells can behave as artificial atoms and, as such, form superlattices with different crystal structures and packing densities. Although ordered superlattices present a high degree of long-range positional order, the relative crystallographic orientation of the inorganic nanocrystals with respect to each other tends to be random. Recent works have shown that superlattices can achieve orientational alignment through combinations of nanocrystal faceting and ligand modification, as well as selective metal particle attachment to particular facets. These studies have focused on the assembly of high-symmetry nanocrystals, such as cubes and cuboctahedra. Here, we study the assembly of elliptically faceted CdSe/CdS core/shell nanocrystals with one distinctive crystallographic orientation along the major elliptical axis. We show that the nanocrystals form an unexpectedly well-ordered translational superlattice, with a degree of order comparable to that achieved with higher-symmetry nanocrystals. Additionally, we show that, due to the particles' faceted shape, the superlattice is characterized by an orientational glass phase in which only certain orientations are possible due to entropically frustrated crystallization. In this phase, the nanocrystals do not exhibit a local orientational ordering but rather have distinct orientations that emerge at different locations within the same domain. The distinct orientations are a result of a facet-to-facet lock-in mechanism that occurs during the self-assembly process. These facet-to-facet alignments force the nanocrystals to tilt on different lattice planes forming different projections that we termed apparent polydispersity. Our experimental realization of an orientational glass phase for multifaceted semiconducting nanocrystals can be used to investigate how this phase is formed and how it can be utilized for potential optical, electrical, and thermal transport applications.</td>

For all values of the pH, the functionalized fullerene interacted with the polymers at the water/toluene interface, forming a nanoparticle network, reducing the interfacial tension. At pH values of 4.84 and 7.8, robust, elastic films were formed at the interface, such that hollow tubules could be formed in situ when an aqueous solution of the functionalized fullerene was jetted into a toluene solution of PS-b-P2VP at a pH of 4.84. With variation of the pH, the mechanical properties of the fullerene/polymer assemblies can be varied by tuning the strength of the interactions between the functionalized fullerenes and the PS-b-P2VP.</td>

      <td>Constructing all-aqueous systems with tailored geometries can generate a new class of biomimetic materials, a fascinating but challenging goal to achieve. Here, by taking advantage of the interfacial complexation of a polyelectrolyte (PE) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), a unique interfacial PE/CNC complex is demonstrated for the stabilization of aqueous two-phase systems and for the fabrication of all-aqueous double emulsions and 3D constructs. The thickness of PE/CNC complex can be effectively adjusted by tuning the osmotic stress imbalance between the two aqueous phases and, during the formation and thickening of PE/CNC complex, individual assemblies can be connected to design hierarchical all-aqueous structures. This new platform affords tremendous potential for engineering biomimetic constructs with advanced functionality, that can be used for chemical separation, delivery, and biphasic cascading reaction vessels.</td>

      <td>Charge transfer (CT) interactions have been widely used to construct supramolecular systems, such as functional nanostructures and gels. However, to date, there is no report on the generation of CT complexes at the liquid-liquid interface. Here, by using an electron-deficient acceptor dissolved in water and an electron-rich donor dissolved in oil, we present the in situ formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil-water interface. With time, CTCSs can assemble into higher-order nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties, allowing the stabilization of liquids and offering the possibility to structure liquids into nonequilibrium shapes. Moreover, due to the redox-responsiveness of the electron-deficient acceptor, the association and dissociation of CTCSs can be reversibly manipulated in a redox process, leading to the switchable assembly and disassembly of the resultant constructs.</td>

      <td>Anisotropic nanoparticles exhibit interesting properties and their controlled assemblies are highly desirable to generate functional materials. Different from their spherical counterparts, the incorporation of anisotropic nanoparticles in nanostructured polymeric matrices such as block copolymer or supramolecules depends not only on the particle/polymer interactions and relative size ratio between the particle and polymer features but also on the interparticle interactions. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by systematically studying the block copolymer based supramolecular nanocomposite containing anisotropic copper sulfide nanodiscs, and evaluate the effect of competition between the ligand polymer interaction and internanodisc interaction on the arrangement and interparticle spacing of nanodiscs once blended with supramolecules. The interdisc interaction was modulated by varying the ligand density and/or the ligand shell thickness on the surface of nanodiscs. Reduction in the interdisc interaction leads to isolated dispersion of nanodiscs in supramolecules. On the other hand, increasing the interdisc interaction results in simultaneous self -assembly of nanodiscs into soft -rod nanoparticles nanodiscs with supramolecules. The length of the soft -rod nanoparticle and the interparticle spacing also shows a strong dependence on the interdisc interaction and can be tailored by adding free small molecules in the supramolecular matrix. These systematic studies provide valuable insights toward relative strength of various interactions that can be readily applied to achieve morphological control in anisotropic particle -containing nanocomposites.</td>

      <td>The photocatalytic conversion of the greenhouse gas CO2 to chemical fuels such as hydrocarbons and alcohols continues to be a promising technology for renewable generation of energy. Major advancements have been made in improving the efficiencies and product selectiveness of currently known CO2 reduction electrocatalysts, nonetheless, materials discovery is needed to enable economically viable, industrial-scale CO2 reduction. We report here the largest CO2 photocathode search to date, starting with 68860 candidate materials, using a rational first-principles computation-based screening strategy to evaluate synthesizability, corrosion resistance, visible-light absorption, and compatibility of the electronic structure with fuel synthesis. The results confirm the observation of the literature that few materials meet the stringent CO2 photocathode requirements, with only 52 materials meeting all requirements. The results are well validated with respect to the literature, with 9 of these materials having been studied for CO2 reduction, and the remaining 43 materials are discoveries from our pipeline that merit further investigation.</td>

      <td>Inspired by the fascinating class of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials, halide double perovskites have emerged as non-toxic Pb-free contenders for application as active layers in opto-electronic devices. Heterovalent substitution of Pb2+ by non-toxic metal cations yields the double-perovskite structure, which allows for compositional flexibility. In fact, the compositional space is large, given that multiple cations and halides can be combined, resulting in &gt;10(6) perovskite combinations. A starkly increasing num-ber of stable halide double-perovskite compositions are theoreti-cally predicted. The synthesis, however, lags behind, and many dou-ble perovskites are primarily synthesized as powder samples instead of thin films. The latter, however, are needed for thin-film devices such as solar cells, light-emitting devices, and thin-film tran-sistors. Comparing the synthetic approaches successfully applied to hybrid perovskites to methods used for the fabrication of double perovskites, the latter are clearly in their very infancy. The question is whether solution engineering and compositional modification strategies can be exploited to match the exceptional optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskites. This review is motivated by a text mining effort that illustrates not only the prevalence of powder over thin-film synthesis but also the discrepancy between the number of compositions experimentally realized and studied and the many predicted compositions. Here we summarize the synthesis aspects of halide double perovskites, and in particular of thin films, including deposition techniques and synthetic modifications to alter film properties.</td>

      <td>Surface ligands impact the properties and chemistry of nanocrystals, but observing ligand binding locations and their effect on nanocrystal shape transformations is challenging. Using graphene liquid cell electron microscopy and the controllable, oxidative etching of gold nanocrystals, the effect of different ligands on nanocrystal etching can be tracked with nanometer spatial resolution. The chemical environment of liquids irradiated with high-energy electrons is complex and potentially harsh, yet it is possible to observe clear evidence for differential binding properties of specific ligands to the nanorods' surface. Exchanging CTAB ligands for PEG-alkanethiol ligands causes the nanorods to etch at a different, constant rate while still maintaining their aspect ratio. Adding cysteine ligands that bind preferentially to nanorod tips induces etching predominantly on the sides of the rods. This etching at the sides leads to Rayleigh instabilities and eventually breaks apart the nanorod into two separate nanoparticles. The shape transformation is controlled by the interplay between atom removal and diffusion of surface atoms and ligands. These in situ observations are confirmed with ex situ colloidal etching reactions of gold nanorods in solution. The ability to monitor the effect of ligands on nanocrystal shape transformations will enable future in situ studies of nanocrystals surfaces and ligand binding positions.</td>

      <td>Damage tolerance can be an elusive characteristic of structural materials requiring both high strength and ductility, properties that are often mutually exclusive. High-entropy alloys are of interest in this regard. Specifically, the single-phase CrMnFeCoNi alloy displays tensile strength levels of similar to 1GPa, excellent ductility (similar to 60-70%) and exceptional fracture toughness (K-JIc&gt;200 MPa root m). Here through the use of in situ straining in an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope, we report on the salient atomistic to micro-scale mechanisms underlying the origin of these properties. We identify a synergy of multiple deformation mechanisms, rarely achieved in metallic alloys, which generates high strength, work hardening and ductility, including the easy motion of Shockley partials, their interactions to form stacking-fault parallelepipeds, and arrest at planar slip bands of undissociated dislocations. We further show that crack propagation is impeded by twinned, nanoscale bridges that form between the near-tip crack faces and delay fracture by shielding the crack tip.</td>

      <td>The low mass density and high mechanical strength of graphene make it an attractive candidate for suspended-membrane energy transducers. Typically, the membrane size dictates the operational frequency and bandwidth. However, in many cases it would be desirable to both lower the resonance frequency and increase the bandwidth, while maintaining overall membrane size. We employ focused ion beam milling or laser ablation to create kirigami-like modification of suspended pure-graphene membranes ranging in size from microns to millimeters. Kirigami engineering successfully reduces the resonant frequency, increases the displacement amplitude, and broadens the effective bandwidth of the transducer. Our results present a promising route to miniaturized wide-band energy transducers with enhanced operational parameter range and efficiency.</td>

      <td>Topological insulators host spin-polarized surface states born out of the energetic inversion of bulk bands driven by the spin-orbit interaction. Here we discover previously unidentified consequences of band-inversion on the surface electronic structure of the topological insulator Bi2Se3. By performing simultaneous spin, time, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we map the spin-polarized unoccupied electronic structure and identify a surface resonance which is distinct from the topological surface state, yet shares a similar spin-orbital texture with opposite orientation. Its momentum dependence and spin texture imply an intimate connection with the topological surface state. Calculations show these two distinct states can emerge from trivial Rashba-like states that change topology through the spin-orbit-induced band inversion. This work thus provides a compelling view of the coevolution of surface states through a topological phase transition, enabled by the unique capability of directly measuring the spin-polarized unoccupied band structure.</td>

      <td>Hydrogen embrittlement of lath martenistic steels is characterized by intergranular and quasi-cleavage transgranular fracture. Recent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses (Nagao et al., 2012a, 2014a, 2014b, 2014c) of samples lifted from beneath fracture surfaces through focused ion beam machining (FIB) revealed a failure mechanism that can be termed hydrogen-enhanced-plasticity mediated decohesion. Fracture occurs by the synergistic action of the hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity and decohesion. In particular, intergranular cracking takes place by dislocation pile-ups impinging on prior austenite grain boundaries and quasi-cleavage is the case when dislocation pile-ups impinge on block boundaries. These high-angle boundaries, which have already weakened by the presence of hydrogen, debond by the pile-up stresses. The micromechanical model of Novak et al. (2010) is used to quantitatively describe and predict the hydrogen-induced failure of these steels. The model predictions verify that introduction of nanosized (Ti,Mo)C precipitates in the steel microstructure enhances the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. The results are used to discuss microstructural designs that are less susceptible to hydrogen induced failure in systems with fixed hydrogen content (closed systems). Published by Elsevier Ltd.</td>

      <td>Thermal percolation in polymer nanocomposites-the rapid increase in thermal transport due to the formation of networks among fillers-is the subject of great interest in thermal management ranging from general utility in multifunctional nanocomposites to high-conductivity applications such as thermal interface materials. However, It remains a challenging subject encompassing both experimental and modeling hurdles. Successful reports of thermal percolation are exclusively found in high-aspect-ratio, conductive fillers such as graphene, albeit at filler loadings significantly higher than the electrical percolation threshold. This anomaly was attributed to the lower filler-matrix thermal conductivity contrast ratio k(f)/km similar to 10(4) compared to electrical conductivity similar to 10(12)-10(16). In a randomly dispersed composite, the _ effect of a low contrast ratio is further accentuated by uncertainties in the morphology of the percolating network and presence of other phases such as disconnected aggregates and colloidal dispersions. Thus, the general properties of percolating networks are convoluted as they lack a defined structure. In contrast, a prototypical system with controllable nanofiller placement enables the elucidation of structure-property relations such as filler size, loading, and assembly. Using self-assembled nanocomposites with a controlled 1,2,3-dimension nanoparticle (NP) arrangement, we demonstrate that thermal percolation can be achieved in spite of using spherical, nonconductive fillers (k(f)/k(m) similar to 60) at a low volume fraction (9 vol %). We observe that the effects of volume fraction, interfacial thermal resistance, and filler conductivity on thermal conductivity depart from effective medium approximations. Most notably, contrast ratio plays a minor role in thermal percolation above k(f) /k(m) similar to 60-a common range for semiconducting nanoparticles/polymer ratios. Our findings bring new perspectives and insights to thermal percolation in nanocomposites, where the limits in contrast ratio, interfacial thermal conductance, and filler size are established.</td>

      <td>The formation of complex hierarchical nanostructures has attracted a lot of attention from both the fundamental science and potential applications point of view. Spherulite structures with radial fibrillar branches have been found in various solids; however, their growth mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report real time imaging of the formation of two-dimensional (2D) iron oxide spherulite nanostructures in a liquid cell using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By tracking the growth trajectories, we show the characteristics of the reaction front and growth kinetics. Our observations reveal that the tip of a growing branch splits as the width exceeds certain sizes (5.5-8.5 nm). The radius of a spherulite nanostructure increases linearly with time at the early stage, transitioning to nonlinear growth at the later stage. Furthermore, a thin layer of solid is accumulated at the tip and nanoparticles from secondary nucleation also appear at the growing front which later develop into fibrillar branches. The spherulite nanostructure is polycrystalline with the co-existence of ferrihydrite and Fe3O4 through-out the growth. A growth model is further established, which provides rational explanations on the linear growth at the early stage and the nonlinearity at the later stage of growth.</td>

      <td>Rational design and synthesis of transition metal sulfide complex nanostructures are significant for achieving desired materials properties for a variety of applications. Herein, we synthesized nickel sulfide (NiS) nanostructures using laser irradiation in an aqueous solution and under the ambient condition. Crystalline nanostructures with high phase-purity were achieved without further calcination. Other transition metal sulfides, such as CuS and ZnS, were also successfully synthesized using the laser irradiation approach, suggesting the practical application of this method. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) measurements show the NiS nanostructures synthesized for 4h (NiS-4h) not only exhibited competitive overpotential (-159 mV vs. RHE at 10 A/g), lower Tafel slope (218 mV/dec) but also delivered long-term stability (14 A/g at -250 mV vs. RHE for 12h). Moreover, the NiS-4h functioned as the electrode for supercapacitor with excellent specific capacitance (3761 F/g at 10 mV/s), reversibility and rate capability (1152 F/g at 100 mV/s). These superb electrochemical performances are attributed to the remarkable value of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and synergistic effect of Ni3+ OOH for HER electrocatalytic activities, while the co-existence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ facilitates the rich redox reactions of NiS for supercapacitor.</td>

      <td>Liquid-fluid interfaces provide a platform both for structuring liquids into complex shapes and assembling dimensionally confined, functional nanomaterials. Historically, attention in this area has focused on simple emulsions and foams, in which surface-active materials such as surfactants or colloids stabilize structures against coalescence and alter the mechanical properties of the interface. In recent decades, however, a growing body of work has begun to demonstrate the full potential of the assembly of nanomaterials at liquid-fluid interfaces to generate functionally advanced, biomimetic systems. Here, a broad overview is given, from fundamentals to applications, of the use of liquid-fluid interfaces to generate complex, all-liquid devices with a myriad of potential applications.</td>

      <td>The valley degree of freedom in two-dimensional (2D) crystals recently emerged as a novel information carrier in addition to spin and charge. The intrinsic valley lifetime in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) is expected to be markedly long due to the unique spin-valley locking behavior, where the intervalley scattering of the electron simultaneously requires a large momentum transfer to the opposite valley and a flip of the electron spin. However, the experimentally observed valley lifetime in 2D TMDs has been limited to tens of nanoseconds thus far. We report efficient generation of microsecond-long-lived valley polarization in WSe2/MoS2 heterostructures by exploiting the ultrafast charge transfer processes in the heterostructure that efficiently creates resident holes in the WSe2 layer. These valley-polarized holes exhibit near-unity valley polarization and ultralong valley lifetime: We observe a valley-polarized hole population lifetime of more than 1 ms and a valley depolarization lifetime (that is, intervalley scattering lifetime) of more than 40 mu s at 10 K. The near-perfect generation of valley-polarized holes in TMD heterostructures, combined with ultralong valley lifetime, which is orders of magnitude longer than previous results, opens up new opportunities for novel valleytronics and spintronics applications.</td>

      <td>To date, there has not yet been a direct observation of the initiation and propagation of individual defects in metallic glasses during deformation at the nanoscale. Here, we show through a combination of in situ nanobeam electron diffraction and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that we can directly observe changes to the local short to medium range atomic ordering during the formation of a shear band. We observe experimentally a spatially resolved reduction of order prior to shear banding due to increased strain. We compare this to molecular dynamics simulations, in which a similar reduction in local order is seen, and caused by shear transformation zone activation, providing direct experimental evidence for this proposed nucleation mechanism for shear bands in amorphous solids. Our observation serves as a link between the atomistic molecular dynamics simulation and the bulk mechanical properties, providing insight into how one could increase ductility in glassy materials.</td>

      <td>The pair interaction potentials of polymer-grafted silica nanoparticles (NPs) at liquid surfaces were determined by scanning electron microscopy, exploiting the nonvolatility of ionic liquids to stabilize the specimens against microscope vacuum. Even at near contact, individual, two-dimensionally well-dispersed NPs were resolved. The potential of mean force, reduced to the pair interaction potential for dilute NPs, was extracted with good accuracy from the radial distribution function, as both NP diameter and grafted polymer chain length were varied. While NP polydispersity somewhat broadened the core repulsion, the pair potential well-approximated a hard sphere interaction, making these systems suitable for model studies of interfacially bound NPs. For short (5 kDa) poly(ethylene glycol) ligands, a weak (&lt;k(B)T) long-range attraction was discerned, and for ligands of identical length, pair potentials overlapped for NPs of different diameter; the attraction is suggested to arise from ligand-induced menisci. To understand better the interactions underlying the pair potential, NP surface-binding energies were measured by interfacial tensiometry, and NP contact angles were assessed by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.</td>

      <td>With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs), a load-bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting the assembly from a liquid-like into a solid-like assembly. Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network is denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid-like state. It is a challenge to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, since both jamming and vitrification lead to a solid-like behavior of the assemblies. Herein, we show a real-time fluorescence imaging method to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of NP surfactants at the water/oil interface using aggregation-induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. The AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior at densities at which they can move and rotate. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the smaller intermolecular separation distance arrests rotation, and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs.</td>

      <td>CrCoNi-based high-entropy alloys have demonstrated outstanding mechanical properties, particularly at cryogenic temperatures. Here we investigate the fatigue-crack propagation properties of the equiatomic, single-phase, face -centered cubic, medium-entropy alloy (MEA), CrCoNi, that displays exceptional strength, ductility and toughness, all of which are enhanced at cryogenic temperatures. Fatigue-crack growth is examined, at a load ratio of 0.1 over a wide range of growth rates, from similar to 10(-11) to &gt;10(-7) m/cycle, at room (293 K) and cryogenic (198 K, 77 K) temperatures for two grain sizes (similar to 7 and 68 mu m), with emphasis on near-threshold behavior. We find that the Delta K-th fatigue thresholds are increased with decreasing temperature and increasing grain size: from 5.7 MPa root m at 293 K to 8 MPa root m at 77 K in the fine-grained alloy, and from 9.4 MPa root m at 293 K to 13.7 MPa root m at 77 K in the coarse grained alloy. Mechanistically, transgranular cracking at 293 K transitions to a mixture of intergranular and transgranular at cryogenic temperatures, where the increased propensity of nano-twins appears to inhibit growth rates by deflecting the crack path. However, the main factor affecting near-threshold behavior is roughness-induced crack closure from interference between the crack flanks, which is enhanced by the rougher fracture surfaces at low temperatures, particularly in the coarser-grained microstructure. Fatigue-crack propagation behavior in CrCoNi is comparable to nickel-based superalloys but is superior to that of the high-entropy CrMnFeCoNi (Cantor) alloy and many high-strength steels, making the CrCoNi alloy an excellent candidate material for safety-critical applications, particularly involving low temperatures.

      <td>The controlled structuring of liquids into arbitrary shapes can be achieved in biphasic liquid media using the interfacial assemblies of nanoparticle surfactants (NP-surfactants), that consist of a polar nanopartide head group bound to one or more hydrophobic polymer tails. The nonequilibrium shapes of the suspended liquid phase can be rendered permanent by the jamming of the NP-surfactants formed and assembled at the interface between the liquids as the system attempts to minimize the interfacial area between the liquids. While critical to the structuring process, little is known of the dynamic mechanical properties of the NP-surfactant monolayer at the interface as it is dictated by the characteristics of the component, including NP size and concentration and the molecular weight and concentration of polymers bound to the NPs. Here we provide the first comprehensive understanding of the dynamic mechanical character of two-dimensional NP-surfactant assemblies at liquid/liquid interfaces. Our results indicate that the dynamics of NP-polymer interactions are self-regulated across multiple time scales and are associated with specific mesoscale interactions between self-similar and cross-complementary components. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the NP-surfactant monolayer are tunable over a broad range and deterministic on the basis of those component inputs. This control is key to tailoring the functional attributes of the reconfigurable structured liquids to suit specific applications.</td>

      <td>Deformation-induced nanoscale twinning is one of the mechanisms responsible for the excellent combination of strength and fracture toughness of the single-phase, face-centered cubic CrMnFeCoNi (Cantor) alloy, especially at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we use a novel, modified dogbone geometry that permits the sampling of varying stress and strain regions within a single tensile specimen to characterize the onset of twinning in CrMnFeCoNi at 293 K, 198 K and 77 K. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and backscattered electron (BSE) imaging revealed the presence of deformation nano-twins in regions of the samples that had experienced plastic strains of similar to 25% at 293 K, similar to 16% at 198 K, and similar to 8% at 77 K, which are similar to the threshold strains described by Laplanche et al. (Acta Mater. 118, 2016, 152-163). From these strains we estimate that the critical tensile stress for the onset of twinning in this alloy is on the order of 750 MPa.</td>

      <td>Ring-shaped nanostructures can focus, filter, and manipulate electromagnetic waves, but are challenging to incorporate into devices using standard nanofabrication techniques. Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) on lithographically patterned templates has successfully been used to fabricate concentric rings and spirals as etching masks. However, this method is limited by BCP phase behavior and material selection. Here, a straightforward approach to generate ring-shaped nanoparticle assemblies in thin films of supramolecular nanocomposites is demonstrated. DSA is used to guide the formation of concentric rings with radii spanning 150-1150 nm and ring widths spanning 30-60 nm. When plasmonic nanoparticles are used, ring nanodevice arrays can be fabricated in one step, and the completed devices produce high-quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Nanocomposite DSA simplifies and streamlines nanofabrication by producing metal structures without etching or deposition steps; it also introduces interparticle coupling as a new design axis. Detailed analysis of the nanoparticle ring assemblies confirms that the supramolecular system self-regulates the spatial distribution of its components, and thus exhibits a degree of flexibility absent in DSA of BCPs alone, where structures are determined by polymer-pattern incommensurability. The present studies also provide guidelines for developing self-regulating DSA as an alternative to incommensurability-driven methods.</td>

      <td>Magnetic refrigeration, as well as waste-heat recovery, can be accomplished through the magnetocaloric effect, where temperature changes the magnetic state of a material or vice versa. Promising magnetocaloric materials display large changes in magnetic entropy (Delta S-M) upon application of a moderate magnetic field and are often associated with magnetic materials possessing some degree of magnetostructural coupling. In such compounds, the magnetic transition is coupled to some structural transition at the ordering temperature, and indicators for these are readily calculated by the magnetic deformation proxy Sigma(M). MnSb, with a Curie temperature T-C = 577 K, has a calculated magnetic deformation of Sigma(M) = 5.9% and is a promising candidate material for waste-heat recovery. The temperature dependence of structural, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties of Mn1+xSb, where x is a tunable amount of interstitial Mn, is studied here. Excess Mn is incorporated as an interstitial whose magnetic moment is antialigned with the stoichiometric Mn, and the excess Mn has the effect of lowering T-C, such that the Curie temperature can be tuned from 577 K to nearly room temperature at 318 K for x = 0.2. For x = 0.0, 0.1, and 0.2, values of Delta S-M under a maximum magnetic field H = 5 T are found to be 3.65, 3.00, and 2.83 J K-1 kg(-1), respectively. While the maximum Delta S-M decreases with x, the high refrigerant capacity a more holistic measure of performance-is retained in this highly tunable system.</td>

      <td>With the goal of accelerating the design and discovery of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for electronic, optoelectronic, and energy storage applications, we present a dataset of predicted electronic structure properties for thousands of MOFs carried out using multiple density functional approximations. Compared to more accurate hybrid functionals, we find that the widely used PBE generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional severely underpredicts MOF band gaps in a largely systematic manner for semi-conductors and insulators without magnetic character. However, an even larger and less predictable disparity in the band gap prediction is present for MOFs with open-shell 3d transition metal cations. With regards to partial atomic charges, we find that different density functional approximations predict similar charges overall, although hybrid functionals tend to shift electron density away from the metal centers and onto the ligand environments compared to the GGA point of reference. Much more significant differences in partial atomic charges are observed when comparing different charge partitioning schemes. We conclude by using the dataset of computed MOF properties to train machine-learning models that can rapidly predict MOF band gaps for all four density functional approximations considered in this work, paving the way for future high-throughput screening studies. To encourage exploration and reuse of the theoretical calculations presented in this work, the curated data is made publicly available via an interactive and user-friendly web application on the Materials Project.</td>

      <td>Strongly correlated insulating Mott and generalized Wigner phases are detected in WSe2/WS2 moire superlattices, and their electrical properties and excited spin states are studied using an optical technique. Moire superlattices can be used to engineer strongly correlated electronic states in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures, as recently demonstrated in the correlated insulating and superconducting states observed in magic-angle twisted-bilayer graphene and ABC trilayer graphene/boron nitride moire superlattices(1-4). Transition metal dichalcogenide moire heterostructures provide another model system for the study of correlated quantum phenomena(5) because of their strong light-matter interactions and large spin-orbit coupling. However, experimental observation of correlated insulating states in this system is challenging with traditional transport techniques. Here we report the optical detection of strongly correlated phases in semiconducting WSe2/WS2 moire superlattices. We use a sensitive optical detection technique and reveal a Mott insulator state at one hole per superlattice site and surprising insulating phases at 1/3 and 2/3 filling of the superlattice, which we assign to generalized Wigner crystallization on the underlying lattice(6-11). Furthermore, the spin-valley optical selection rules(12-14) of transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures allow us to optically create and investigate low-energy excited spin states in the Mott insulator. We measure a very long spin relaxation lifetime of many microseconds in the Mott insulating state, orders of magnitude longer than that of charge excitations. Our studies highlight the value of using moire superlattices beyond graphene to explore correlated physics.</td>

      <td>Quantitatively correlating the amorphous structure in metallic glasses (MGs) with their physical properties has been a long-sought goal. Here we introduce 'flexibility volume' as a universal indicator, to bridge the structural state the MG is in with its properties, on both atomic and macroscopic levels. The flexibility volume combines static atomic volume with dynamics information via atomic vibrations that probe local configurational space and interaction between neighbouring atoms. We demonstrate that flexibility volume is a physically appropriate parameter that can quantitatively predict the shear modulus, which is at the heart of many key properties of MGs. Moreover, the new parameter correlates strongly with atomic packing topology, and also with the activation energy for thermally activated relaxation and the propensity for stress-driven shear transformations. These correlations are expected to be robust across a very wide range of MG compositions, processing conditions and length scales.</td>

      <td>Ever-harsher service conditions in the future will call for materials with increasing ability to undergo deformation without sustaining damage while retaining high strength. Prime candidates for these conditions are certain high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which have extraordinary work-hardening ability and toughness. By subjecting the equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi HEA to severe plastic deformation through swaging followed by either quasi-static compression or dynamic deformation in shear, we observe a dense structure comprising stacking faults, twins, transformation from the face-centered cubic to the hexagonal close-packed structure, and, of particular note, amorphization. The coordinated propagation of stacking faults and twins along {111} planes generates high-deformation regions, which can reorganize into hexagonal packets; when the defect density in these regions reaches a critical level, they generate islands of amorphous material. These regions can have outstanding mechanical properties, which provide additional strengthening and/or toughening mechanisms to enhance the capability of these alloys to withstand extreme loading conditions.</td>

      <td>In materials science, it is often assumed that ground-state crystal structures predicted by density functional theory are the easiest polymorphs to synthesize. Ternary nitride materials, with many possible metastable polymorphs, provide a rich materials space to study what influences thermodynamic stability and polymorph synthesizability. For example, ZnZrN2 is theoretically predicted at zero Kelvin to have an unusual layered wurtsalt ground-state crystal structure with compelling optoelectronic properties, but it is unknown whether this structure can be realized experimentally under practical synthesis conditions. Here, we use combinatorial sputtering to synthesize hundreds of ZnxZr1-xNy thin-film samples, and find metastable rocksalt-derived or boron-nitride-derived structures rather than the predicted wurtsalt structure. Using a statistical polymorph sampler approach, it is demonstrated that although rocksalt is the least stable polymorph at zero Kelvin, it becomes the most stable polymorph at high effective temperatures similar to those achieved using this sputter deposition method, and thus corroborates experimental results. Additional calculations show that this destabilization of the wurtsalt polymorph is due to configurational entropic and enthalpic effects, and that vibrational contributions are negligible. Specifically, rocksalt- and boron-nitride-derived structures become the most stable polymorphs in the presence of disorder because of higher tolerances to cation cross substitution and off stoichiometry than the wurtsalt structure. This understanding of the role of disorder tolerance in the synthesis of competing polymorphs can enable more accurate predictions of synthesizable crystal structures and their achievable material properties.</td>

      <td>Methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI(3)) exhibits long charge carrier lifetimes that are linked to its high efficiency in solar cells. Yet, the mechanisms governing these unusual carrier dynamics are not completely understood. A leading hypothesis-disproved in this work-is that a large, static bulk Rashba effect slows down carrier recombination. Here, using second harmonic generation rotational anisotropy measurements on MAPbI(3) crystals, we demonstrate that the bulk structure of tetragonal MAPbI(3) is centrosymmetric with I-4/mcm space group. Our calculations show that a significant Rashba splitting in the bandstructure requires a non-centrosymmetric lead iodide framework, and that incorrect structural relaxations are responsible for the previously predicted large Rashba effect. The small Rashba splitting allows us to compute effective masses in excellent agreement with experiment. Our findings rule out the presence of a large static Rashba effect in bulk MAPbI(3), and our measurements find no evidence of dynamic Rashba effects.</td>

      <td>Surface adsorption is a crucial step in numerous processes, including heterogeneous catalysis, where the adsorption of key species is often used as a descriptor of efficiency. We present here an automated adsorption workflow for semiconductors which employs density functional theory calculations to generate adsorption data in a high-throughput manner. Starting from a bulk structure, the workflow performs an exhaustive surface search, followed by an adsorption structure construction step, which generates a minimal energy landscape to determine the optimal adsorbate-surface distance. An extensive set of energy-based, charge-based, geometric, and electronic descriptors tailored toward catalysis research are computed and saved to a personal user database. The application of the workflow to zinc telluride, a promising CO2 reduction photocatalyst, is presented as a case study to illustrate the capabilities of this method and its potential as a material discovery tool.</td>

      <td>A theoretical examination of the thermal expansion behavior of a variety of metals is conducted using a combination of nonlinear elasticity theory and first-principles calculations that is suitable for high throughput computation. Results of this method show good agreement with experimental values. This method is then used to better understand the low thermal expansion behavior of gum metal by comparing the thermal expansion tensor of Ti3Nb austenitic (beta) and martensitic (alpha '') gum metal approximants. The thermal expansion coefficient of beta is found to be in agreement with experimental results for that of annealed gum metal. The thermal expansion tensor of the alpha '' phase is shown to be highly anisotropic and exhibit negative thermal expansion along &lt; 110 &gt;(beta). It is demonstrated that the thermal expansion of the two-phase system, beta + alpha '',can be estimated using the rule of mixing. By applying this averaging scheme and allowing a texturing along &lt; 110 &gt;{001}(beta) in tandem with the growth of the alpha '' phase, values for the thermal expansion similar to that seen in cold-rolled gum metal are calculated.</td>

      <td>Electrocatalysis provides a potential solution to NO3- pollution in wastewater by converting it to innocuous N-2 gas. However, materials with excellent catalytic activity are typically limited to expensive precious metals, hindering their commercial viability. In response to this challenge, we have conducted the most extensive computational search to date for electrocatalysts that can facilitate NO3- reduction reaction, starting with 59 390 candidate bimetallic alloys from the Materials Project and Automatic-Flow databases. Using a joint machine learning- and computation-based screening strategy, we evaluated our candidates based on corrosion resistance, catalytic activity, N-2 selectivity, cost, and the ability to synthesize. We found that only 20 materials will satisfy all criteria in our screening strategy, all of which contain varying amounts of Cu. Our proposed list of candidates is consistent with previous materials investigated in the literature, with the exception of Cu-Co and Cu-Ag based compounds that merit further investigation.

      <td>The first-cycle behavior of layered Li-rich oxides, including Li2MnO3 activation and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation, significantly influences their electrochemical performance. However, the Li2MnO3 activation pathway and the CEI formation process are still controversial. Here, the first-cycle properties of xLi(2)MnO(3)-(1-x) LiNi0.3Co0.3Mn0.4O2 (x = 0, 0.5, 1) cathode materials were studied with an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). The results demonstrate that a synergistic effect between the layered Li2MnO3 and LiNi0.3Co0.3Mn0.4O2 structures can significantly affect the activation pathway of Li1.2Ni0.12Co0.12Mn0.56O2, leading to an extra-high capacity. It is demonstrated that Li2MnO3 activation in Li-rich materials is dominated by electrochemical decomposition (oxygen redox), which is different from the activation process of pure Li2MnO3 governed by chemical decomposition (Li2O evolution). CEI evolution is closely related to Li+ extraction/insertion. The valence state variation of the metal ions (Ni, Co, Mn) in Li-rich materials can promote CEI formation. This study is of significance for understanding and designing Li-rich cathode-based batteries.</td>

      <td>The self-assembly of nanoscale materials at the liquid liquid interface allows for fabrication of threedimensionally structured liquids with nearly arbitrary geometries and tailored electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are highly anisotropic, with thicknesses on the order of a nanometer and lateral dimensions upward of hundreds of nanometers to micrometers. Controlling the assembly of these materials has direct implications for their properties and performance. We here describe the interfacial assembly and jamming of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets at the oil water interface. Planar, as well as complex, programmed three-dimensional all-liquid objects are realized. Our approach presents potential for the creation of all-liquid 3D-printed devices for possible applications in all-liquid electrochemical and energy storage devices and electrically active, all-liquid fluidics that exploits the versatile structure, functionality, and reconfigurability of liquids.</td>

      <td>Metastable carbonates play important roles in geochemistry, biomineralization and serve as model systems for nonclassical theories of nucleation and growth. Balcite (Ca0.5Ba0.5CO3) is a remarkable carbonate phase that is isostructural with a high-temperature modification of calcite (CaCO3), yet can be synthesized at ambient conditions. Here, we investigate crystallization pathways in the Ba-Ca-CO3-H2O system, with a focus on the transformation of amorphous calcium barium carbonate (ACBC) to balcite and subsequent decomposition into the equilibrium calcite (CaCO3) and witherite (BaCO3) phases. Density functional theory calculations show that balcite is an unstable solid solution (Ca1-xBaxCO3, R (3) over tildem) in the range 0.17 &lt; x &lt; 0.5, but is accessible through the amorphous ACBC precursor for x less than or similar to 0.5, and predict its decomposition into calcite and witherite. We confirm this pathway experimentally but found demixing to proceed slowly and remain incomplete even after 9 months. Nucleation kinetics of balcite from ACBC was assessed using a microfluidic assay, where increasing barium content led to a surprising increase in the balcite nucleation rate, despite decreasing thermodynamic driving force. We attribute crystallization rates that dramatically accelerate with time to changes in interfacial structure and composition during coarsening of the amorphous precipitate. By carefully quantifying the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions in the multistep crystallization of a metastable carbonate, we produce insights that allow us to better interpret the formation and persistence of metastable minerals in natural and synthetic environments.</td>

      <td>Electronic waste carries energetic costs and an environmental burden rivaling that of plastic waste due to the rarity and toxicity of the heavy-metal components. Recyclable conductive composites are introduced for printed circuits formulated with polycaprolactone (PCL), conductive fillers, and enzyme/protectant nanoclusters. Circuits can be printed with flexibility (breaking strain approximate to 80%) and conductivity (approximate to 2.1 x 10(4) S m(-1)). These composites are degraded at the end of life by immersion in warm water with programmable latency. Approximately 94% of the functional fillers can be recycled and reused with similar device performance. The printed circuits remain functional and degradable after shelf storage for at least 7 months at room temperature and one month of continuous operation under electrical voltage. The present studies provide composite design toward recyclable and easily disposable printed electronics for applications such as wearable electronics, biosensors, and soft robotics.</td>

      <td>Nanoscale engineered materials such as nanocomposites can display or be designed to enhance their material properties through control of the internal interfaces. Here, we unveil the nanoscale origin and important characteristics of the enhanced dielectric breakdown capabilities of gold nanoparticle/polymer nanocomposites. Our multiscale approach spans from the study of a single chemically designed organic/inorganic interface to micrometer-thick films At the nanoscale, we relate the improved breakdown strength to the interfacial charge retention capability by combining scanning probe measurements and density functional theory calculations. At the meso- and macroscales, our findings highlight the relevance of the nanoparticle concentration and distribution in determining and enhancing the dielectric properties, as well as identifying this as a crucial limiting factor for the achievable sample size.</td>

      <td>Lead-free halide double perovskites with enhanced stability have gained attention as a promising environmentally friendly alternative to lead-based halide perovskites. Amongst different halide double perovskites, Cs2AgBiBr6 has shown attractive optoelectronic properties and stability, making it a promising candidate for stable high-efficiency optoelectronic devices. Motivated by a data mining effort, we present here the effects of different processing strategies on the microstructure and thin-film formation dynamics of Cs2AgBiBr6. We apply some of the most successfully used solvent engineering approaches from the halide perovskite research to halide double perovskites, namely antisolvent- and additive-assisted synthesis. Using in situ spectroscopy and diffraction, the film formation of Cs2AgBiBr6 is investigated during spin coating, and the subsequent post-deposition thermal annealing. Dropping antisolvents during spin coating induces immediate supersaturation and crystallization of the wet film, whereas the time of dropping the antisolvent has implications on the film formation dynamics and the final microstructure. For additive (HBr)-assisted synthesis, we show how the addition of HBr affects colloid formation in solution and thus influences the crystallization pathway during thin-film processing. Finally, HBr additive simplifies synthesis in that it doesn't require solution and substrate preheating to obtain pinhole-free films even with higher thickness.</td>

      <td>Nanoparticle surfactant (NPS) offers a powerful strategy to generate all-liquid constructs that integrate the inherent properties of the NPs into 3D architectures. Here, using the co-assembly of fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles and amine-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane, the assembly and jamming behavior of a new type of NPS at the oil-water interface is uncovered. Unlike solid inorganic nanoparticles, soft polymeric nanoparticles can reorganize when jammed, leading to a relaxation and deformation of the interfacial assemblies, for example, the 3D printed sugar-coated haw stick-like liquid tubules. With NPS serving as emulsifiers, stable Pickering emulsions are prepared that can be converted into robust colloidosomes with pH responsiveness, showing numerous potential applications for encapsulation and controlled release.</td>

      <td>Co-assembly of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) and nanostructured polymer matrix represents an intricate interplay of enthalpic or entropic forces. Particle size largely affects the phase behavior of the nanocomposite. Theoretical studies indicate that new morphologies would emerge when the particles become comparable to the soft matrix's size, but this has rarely been supported experimentally. By designing a multicomponent blend composed of NPs, block copolymer-based supramolecules, and small molecules, a 3-D ordered lattice beyond the native BCP's morphology was recently reported when the particle is larger than the microdomain of BCP. The blend can accommodate various formulation variables. In this paper, when the particle size equals the microdomain size, a symmetry-broken phase appears in a narrow range of particle sizes and compositions, which we named the train track structure. In this phase, the NPs aligned into a 3-D hexagonal lattice and packed asymmetrically along the c axis, making the projection of the ac and the be plane resemble train tracks. Computational studies show that the broken symmetry reduces the polymer chain deformation and stabilizes the metastable hexagonally perforated lamellar morphology. Given the mobility of the multicomponent blend, the system shows a self-sorting behavior: segregating into two macroscopic phases with different nanostructures based on only a few nanometers NP size differences. Smaller NPs form train track morphology, while larger NPs form a simple hexagon structure, where the NPs take a symmetric hexagonal arrangement. Detailed structural evolution and simulation studies confirm the systematic-wide cooperativity across different components, indicating the strong self-regulation of the multicomponent system.</td>

      <td>The photon-like behavior of electrons in graphene causes unusual confinement properties that depend strongly on the geometry and strength of the surrounding potential. We report bottom-up synthesis of atomically-precise one-dimensional (1D) arrays of point charges on graphene that allow exploration of a new type of supercritical confinement of graphene carriers. The arrays were synthesized by arranging F(4)TCNQ molecules into a 1D lattice on back-gated graphene, allowing precise tuning of both the molecular charge and the array periodicity. While dilute arrays of ionized F(4)TCNQ molecules are seen to behave like isolated subcritical charges, dense arrays show emergent supercriticality. In contrast to compact supercritical clusters, these extended arrays display both supercritical and subcritical characteristics and belong to a new physical regime termed frustrated supercritical collapse. Here carriers in the far-field are attracted by a supercritical charge distribution, but their fall to the center is frustrated by subcritical potentials in the near-field, similar to trapping of light by a dense cluster of stars in general relativity.</td>

      <td>Bicontinuous jammed emulsions (or bijels) are tortuous, interconnected structures of two immiscible liquids, kinetically trapped by colloidal particles that are irreversibly bound to the oil-water interface(1,2). A wealth of applications has been proposed for bijels in catalysis, energy storage and molecular encapsulation(3-5), but large domain sizes (on the order of 5 mu m or larger) and difficulty in fabrication pose major barriers to their use(6-8). Here, we show that bijels with sub-micrometre domains can be formed via homogenization, rather than spinodal decomposition. We achieve this by using nanoparticle surfactants: polymers and nanoparticles of complementary functionality (for example, ion-pairing) that bind to one another at the oil-water interface(9,10). This allows the stabilization of the bijel far from the demixing point of the liquids, with interfacial tensions on the order of 20 mN m(-1). Furthermore, our strategy is extremely versatile, as solvent, nanoparticle and ligand can all be varied.</td>

      <td>Na metal is an attractive anode material for rechargeable Na ion batteries, however, the dendritic growth of Na can cause serious safety issues. Along with modifications of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), engineering the electrode has been reported to be effective in suppressing Na dendritic growth, likely by reducing localized current density accumulation. However, fundamental understanding of Na growth at the nanoscale is still limited. Here, we report an in-situ study of Na electrodeposition in electrochemical liquid cells with the electrodes in different surface roughness, e.g., flat or sharp curvature. Real time observation using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals the Na electrodeposition with remarkable details. Relatively large Na grains (in the micrometer scale) are achieved on the flat electrode surface. The local SEI thickness variations impact the growth rate, thus the morphology of individual grains. In contrast, small Na grains (in tens of nanometers) grow explosively on the electrode at the point with sharp curvature. The newly formed Na grains preferentially deposit at the base of existing grains close to the electrode. Further studies using continuum-based computational modeling suggest that the growth mode of an alkali metal (e.g. Na) is strongly influenced by the transport properties of SEI. Our direct observation of Na deposition in combination with the theoretical modeling provides insights for comprehensive understanding of electrode roughness and SEI effects on Na electrochemical deposition.</td>

      <td>Chirality reveals symmetry breaking of the fundamental interaction of elementary particles. In condensed matter, for example, the chirality of electrons governs many unconventional transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect. Here we show that phonons can exhibit intrinsic chirality in monolayer tungsten diselenide. The broken inversion symmetry of the lattice lifts the degeneracy of clockwise and counterclockwise phonon modes at the corners of the Brillouin zone. We identified the phonons by the intervalley transfer of holes through hole-phonon interactions during the indirect infrared absorption, and we confirmed their chirality by the infrared circular dichroism arising from pseudoangular momentum conservation. The chiral phonons are important for electron-phonon coupling in solids, phonon-driven topological states, and energy-efficient information processing.</td>

      <td>A Li-rich polyanionic compound based on V3+ with a previously unknown structure, Li5VF4(SO4)(2), has been developed as a high-voltage cathode material for Li-ion batteries. The solvothermal preparation of this material, crystal structure solution, and initial electrochemical characterization are presented. An analysis based on density functional theory electronic structure calculations suggests that a high voltage close to 5 V is required to extract two Li ions and to reach the oxidation state of V5+. However, the use of conventional carbonate-based electrolytes, which exhibit increasing degradation above a potential of 4.3 V, does not permit the full capacity of this compound to be achieved at this time.</td>

      <td>The polymer chain architecture is an important factor determining the phase behavior of nanoparticle (NP) assembly in polymer matrices. Block copolymers (BCPs) containing a random copolymer (RCP) block present a convenient variation on traditional BCPs to tune the interaction parameters between the polymer blocks and the nanofillers as well as to evaluate the effect of the chain architecture on the NP arrangements within BCP microdomains. Here, we synthesized BCPs with a coil polystyrene (PS) block and a comb RCP block through reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The RCP block consists of methyl- and lauryl acrylates, the latter of which confers a long-chain alkyl moiety to favorably interact with alkyl-passivated NPs. BCPs showing lamellar, cylindrical, and mixed morphologies were obtained by varying the volume fractions of the RCP block (f(RCP)). In comparison to coil-coil BCP, the coil-comb BCPs show highly asymmetric phase behavior with respect to f(RCP), where lamellar morphologies were observed at f(RCP) from 0.31 to 0.51. NPs in the size of 4-5 nm were successfully incorporated in the RCP block of the BCPs with periodicities of 30-60 nm. An order-to-order phase transition from lamellae to PS cylinders was observed after the addition of only 1-2 vol % 5 nm NPs into the BCP with a periodicity of 25 nm and f RCP of 0.51. Self-consistent field theory-density functional theory simulations qualitatively described the observed morphologies and phase transitions in the nanocomposites. The current study presents a platform to fabricate nanocomposites with NP assemblies in coil-comb BCPs that contain a random copolymer block and provides insight into how polymer chain architectures can affect the phase behavior of BCPs and nanocomposites.</td>

      <td>In the past few decades, novel syntheses of a wide range of nanoparticles (NPs) with well-defined chemical composition and structure have opened tremendous opportunities in areas ranging from optical and electronic devices to biomedical markers. Controlling the assembly of such well-defined NPs is important to effectively harness their unique properties. The assembly of NPs at liquid-liquid interfaces is becoming a central topic both in surface and colloid science. Hierarchical structures, including 2D films, 3D capsules, and structured liquids, have been generating significant interest and are showing promise for physical, chemical, and biological applications. Here, a brief overview of the development of the self-assembly of NPs at liquid-liquid interfaces is provided, from theory to experiment, from synthetic NPs to bio-nanoparticles, from water-oil to water-water, and from liquid-like to solid-like assemblies.</td>

      <td>Surface oxidation, as one of fundamental chemical reactions in metals, greatly affects their properties. Herein, we develop a new quaternary GaInSnZn liquid metal with the melting temperature of 9.7 degrees C, which is the lowest among all reported Ga-based liquid metals. With high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we directly observed the oxide layer formed on the surface of the liquid metal. The initially formed oxide layer is revealed to be amorphous and very sensitive to electron beam. Prolonged irradiation results in its structural change from amorphous to crystalline phases. The present finding refreshes the basic understanding of surface oxidization of liquid metals and opens up the possibility of tuning surface structures and morphologies by using electron beam irradiation.</td>

      <td>Conjugated molecules and polymers have the ability to be transformative semiconducting materials; however, to reach their full potential a detailed understanding of the factors governing the molecular structure is crucial for establishing design principles for improved materials. Creating planar or locking structures is of particular interest for tuning electronic properties. While noncovalent locks are an effective strategy for increasing planarity, the precise interactions leading to these planar structures are often unknown or mischaracterized. In this study, we demonstrate that aromaticity can be used to investigate, interpret, and modify the complex physical interactions which lead to planarity. Furthermore, we clearly illustrate the important role aromaticity has in determining the structure through torsional preferences and find that modern noncovalent locks utilize hyperconjugation to alter aromaticity and increase planarity. We envision that our approach and our explanation of prevalent noncovalent locks will assist in the design of improved materials for organic electronics.</td>

      <td>Nuclear-grade graphite is a critically important high-temperature structural material for current and potentially next generation of fission reactors worldwide. It is imperative to understand its damage-tolerant behaviour and to discern the mechanisms of damage evolution under in-service conditions. Here we perform in situ mechanical testing with synchrotron X-ray computed micro-tomography at temperatures between ambient and 1,000 degrees C on a nuclear-grade Gilsocarbon graphite. We find that both the strength and fracture toughness of this graphite are improved at elevated temperature. Whereas this behaviour is consistent with observations of the closure of microcracks formed parallel to the covalent-sp(2)-bonded graphene layers at higher temperatures, which accommodate the more than tenfold larger thermal expansion perpendicular to these layers, we attribute the elevation in strength and toughness primarily to changes in the residual stress state at 800-1,000 degrees C, specifically to the reduction in significant levels of residual tensile stresses in the graphite that are ` frozen-in' following processing.</td>

      <td>Obtaining information about the structure of metal-organic layers (MOLs) using standard electron microscopy methods is challenging due to damage under electron beam irradiation. Here, the authors reveal a multistep formation process of MOLs and identify missing clusters, dislocations, loop and flat surface terminations and ligand connector of MOLs via complementary electron microscopy techniques. Metal-organic layers (MOLs) are highly attractive for application in catalysis, separation, sensing and biomedicine, owing to their tunable framework structure. However, it is challenging to obtain comprehensive information about the formation and local structures of MOLs using standard electron microscopy methods due to serious damage under electron beam irradiation. Here, we investigate the growth processes and local structures of MOLs utilizing a combination of liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy, cryogenic electron microscopy and electron ptychography. Our results show a multistep formation process, where precursor clusters first form in solution, then they are complexed with ligands to form non-crystalline solids, followed by the arrangement of the cluster-ligand complex into crystalline sheets, with additional possible growth by the addition of clusters to surface edges. Moreover, high-resolution imaging allows us to identify missing clusters, dislocations, loop and flat surface terminations and ligand connectors in the MOLs. Our observations provide insights into controllable MOL crystal morphology, defect engineering, and surface modification, thus assisting novel MOL design and synthesis.</td>

      <td>In comparison to top-down approaches, nanocomposite thin films are more compatible with nanoparticle (NP) chemistry, device integration, and scalable manufacturing. Nanocomposites have long been promised as an ideal option to fabricate metamaterials that harvest the collective properties enabled by ordered 3D NP assemblies. However, most of accessible NP assemblies, governed by their phase diagrams, are not suitable to achieve the targeted properties and require lengthy assembly processes. Here, we investigated the kinetic pathway of NP assembly in lamellar supramolecular nanocomposite thin films during solvent vapor annealing and after solvent removal. By balancing the solvent field, diffusion rate, and thermodynamic driving force during rapid solvent removal (&lt;3 s), we produced well-ordered 3D NP assemblies far away from the equilibrium state. Their degree of ordering depends on the terminal solvent fraction rather than the exact rapid solvent removal rate. The periodicity of these nanocomposites can be readily decoupled from the NP size and reduced to similar to 50% of the periodicity in melt. The current study provides a facile approach to access nonequilibrium structures in nanocomposite thin films for the fabrication of functional metamaterial coatings.</td>

      <td>Research publications are the major repository of scientific knowledge. However, their unstructured and highly heterogenous format creates a significant obstacle to large-scale analysis of the information contained within. Recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) has provided a variety of tools for high-quality information extraction from unstructured text. These tools are primarily trained on non-technical text and struggle to produce accurate results when applied to scientific text, involving specific technical terminology. During the last years, significant efforts in information retrieval have been made for biomedical and biochemical publications. For materials science, text mining (TM) methodology is still at the dawn of its development. In this review, we survey the recent progress in creating and applying TM and NLP approaches to materials science field. This review is directed at the broad class of researchers aiming to learn the fundamentals of TM as applied to the materials science publications.</td>

      <td>The scope of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) structures accessible through bottom-up approaches is defined by the intrinsic limitations of either all-on-surface or all-solution-based synthesis. Here, we report a hybrid bottom-up synthesis of GNRs based on a Matrix-Assisted Direct (MAD) transfer technique that successfully leverages technical advantages inherent to both solution-based and on-surface synthesis while sidestepping their drawbacks. Critical structural parameters tightly controlled in solution-based polymerization reactions can seamlessly be translated into the structure of the corresponding GNRs. The transformative potential of the synergetic bottom-up approaches facilitated by the MAD transfer techniques is highlighted by the synthesis of chevron-type GNRs (cGNRs) featuring narrow length distributions and a nitrogen core-doped armchair GNR (N-4-7-ANGR) that remains inaccessible using either a solution-based or an on-surface bottom-up approach alone.</td>

      <td>Nanoparticles (NPs) segregated to the liquid/liquid interface form disordered or liquid-like assemblies that show diffusive motions in the plane of the interface. As the areal density of NPs at the interface increases, the available interfacial area decreases, and the interfacial dynamics of the NP assemblies change when the NPs jam. Dynamics associated with jamming was investigated by X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. Water-in-toluene emulsions, formed by a self-emulsification at the liquid/liquid interface and stabilized by ligand-capped CdSe-ZnS NPs, provided a simple, yet powerful platform, to investigate NP dynamics. In contrast to a single planar interface, these emulsions increased the number of NPs in the incident beam and decreased the absorption of X-rays in comparison to the same path length in pure water. A transition from diffusive to confined dynamics was manifested by intermittent dynamics, indicating a transition from a liquid-like to a jammed state.</td>

      <td>Embedding catalysts inside of plastics affords accelerated chemical modification with programmable latency and pathways. Nanoscopically embedded enzymes can lead to near-complete degradation of polyesters via chain-end mediated processive depolymerization. The overall degradation rate and pathways have a strong dependence on the morphology of semicrystalline polyesters. Yet, most studies to date focus on pristine polymers instead of mixtures that contain additives and other components despite their nearly universal use in plastic production. Here, additives are introduced to purposely change the morphology of polycaprolactone (PCL) by increasing the bending and twisting of crystalline lamellae. These morphological changes immobilize chain ends preferentially at the crystalline/amorphous interfaces and limit chain-end accessibility by the embedded processive enzyme. This chain-end redistribution reduces the polymer-to-monomer conversion from &gt;95% to less than 50%, causing formation of highly crystalline plastic pieces, including microplastics. By synergizing both random chain scission and processive depolymerization, it is feasible to navigate morphological changes in polymer/additive blends and to achieve near-complete depolymerization. The random scission enzymes in the amorphous domains create new chain ends that are subsequently bound and depolymerized by processive enzymes. Present studies further highlight the importance to consider how the host polymer's morphologies affect the reactions catalyzed by embedded catalytic species.</td>

As high as 11 dB extinction ratio is achieved by varying the voltage applied to a single atomic layer of graphene on a HCG resonator. The device topology facilitates easy fabrication of large 2D arrays, and free-space operation. We also demonstrate a graphene-oxide-graphene structure which can potentially operate at MHz operation speed. The devices are fully fabricated by standard CMOS compatible processes indicating that the integrated structure of graphene-on-HCG shows great promise for display, imaging and interconnects applications with low-cost and large scalability.

      <td>Although fatigue is by far the most common mode of failure of structural materials, mechanistic understanding is still lacking. For example, the fundamental Paris law which relates the crack growth rate to stress-intensity factor range is still phenomenological and no reliable mechanistic model has been established for a given material or class of materials despite numerous investigations over a half a century. This work is an attempt to theoretically model fatigue crack propagation induced by alternating crack-tip plastic blunting and re-sharpening in the mid-range of growth rates on the basis of inputs from experiments that measure macroscopic material behavior, e.g., response to uniaxial cycling loading. In particular, we attempt to predict Paris law behavior by accounting for the material constitutive behavior in response to cyclic loading by modeling crack advance solely in terms of the underlying plastic dissipation. We obtain the steady-state condition for crack growth based on plastic dissipation, numerically using finite element analysis, which involves a methodology to address plastic closure upon unloading. For a given stress-intensity range, we calculate the crack propagation rate from the steady-state condition through each cycle of loading and unloading of a cracked compact-tension specimen, without resorting to any specific criterion for crack advance.

      <td>Orthogonal to guided growth of nanoparticle (NP) crystals using DNA or supramolecules, a trace amount of polymeric impurities (&lt;0.1 wt.%) leads to reproducible, rapid growth of 3D NP crystals in solution and on patterned substrates with high yield. When polymers preferentially precipitate on the NP surfaces, small NP clusters form and serve as nuclei for NP crystal growth in dilute solutions. This precipitation-induced NP crystallization process is applicable for a range of polymers, and the resultant 3-D NP crystals are tunable by varying polymeric additives loading, solvent evaporation rate, and NP size. The present study elucidates how to balance cohesive energy density and NP diffusivity to simultaneously favor nuclei formation energetically and kinetic growth in dilute solutions to rapidly crystalize NPs over multiple length scales. Furthermore, the amount of impurities needed to grow NP crystals (&lt;0.1%) reminds us the importance of fine details to interpret experimental observations in nanoscience. Growing nanoparticle crystals typically requires strict control over interparticle interactions and assembly. Here, the authors show that a trace amount of polymeric impurities induces reproducible, rapid growth of high quality 3D nanoparticle crystals in solution and on patterned substrates.</td>

      <td>Point contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy has been utilized to determine the spin polarization of both amorphous and crystalline FexSi1-x (0.58 &lt; x &lt; 0.68) thin films. The amorphous materials exhibited a substantial spin polarization (generally greater than 60%), despite significant changes in magnetization and resistivity. In particular, the polarization value in the x = 0.65 amorphous alloy is about 70%, significantly higher than most ferromagnets, including numerous Heusler compounds that are theoretically predicted to be half-metallic ferromagnets. The composition dependence of the spin polarization in the amorphous materials is proportional to (but substantially larger than) the DFT-calculated values. The polarization of a crystalline thin film with x = 0.65, by contrast, is only 49%, similar to that of common magnetic metals. The enhanced spin polarization in the amorphous structure is attributed to the modification of the local environments. This work demonstrates that the spin polarization, as well as magnetic moment, anomalous Hall effect, and electrical resistivity, can be tuned by introducing structural disorder as an engineering tool.</td>

      <td>It is crucial to suppress lithium dendrite formation in lithium metal batteries. Formation of a good solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been considered to be effective in limiting lithium dendrite growth. However, how the SEI may be modified during lithium deposition is hard to resolve due to challenges inin situinvestigation of the SEI with fine details. We report anin situstudy that uncovers the lithium dendrite suppression mechanism arising from SEI modification by a poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) cationic polymer film, using electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Lithium nanogranules are obtained in the presence of the polymer film. Chemical mapping of the deposits provides remarkable details of the SEI on individual nanogranules. It shows that lithium fluorides are uniformly distributed within the inner SEI layer of individual lithium nanogranules, arising from the instantaneous reaction of the deposited lithium with PF(6)(-)ions accumulated by the cationic polymer film, and thus the dendritic growth of lithium is prohibited. The ability to directly measure SEI chemistry at the nanoscale down to the individual nanograinsin situand unveil its correlation with the lithium deposition behavior opens future opportunities to explore unsolved mechanisms in batteries.</td>

      <td>Strong spin-orbit coupling creates exotic electronic states such as Rashba and topological surface states, which hold promise for technologies involving the manipulation of spin. Only recently has the complexity of these surface states been appreciated: they are composed of several atomic orbitals with distinct spin textures in momentum space. A complete picture of the wave function must account for this orbital dependence of spin. We discover that symmetry constrains the way orbital and spin components of a state coevolve as a function of momentum, and from this, we determine the rules governing how the two degrees of freedom are interwoven. We directly observe this complexity in spin-resolved photoemission and ab initio calculations of the topological surface states of Sb(111), where the photoelectron spin direction near (Gamma) over bar is found to have a strong and unusual dependence on photon polarization. This dependence unexpectedly breaks down at large |k|, where the surface states mix with other nearby surface states. However, along mirror planes, symmetry protects the distinct spin orientations of different orbitals. Our discovery broadens the understanding of surface states with strong spin-orbit coupling, demonstrates the conditions that allow for optical manipulation of photoelectron spin, and will be highly instructive for future spintronics applications.</td>

      <td>Oriented attachment of nanocrystals is an important route to constructing epitaxially-connected nanocrystal superlattices for various applications. During oriented attachment of semiconductor nanocrystals, neck can be formed between nanocrystals and it strongly influences the properties of the resulting superlattice. However, the neck formation mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we use in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy to directly observe the initiation and growth of homoepitaxial necks between PbSe nanocrystals with atomic details. We find that neck initiation occurs slowly (similar to 10 s) when two nanocrystals approach to each other within an edge-to-edge distance of 0.6 nm. During neck initiation, Pb and Se atoms defuse from other facets into the gap, forming dynamic reversible filaments. Once the filament (neck) width is larger than a critical size of 0.9 nm, it gradually (15 s) widens into a 3-nm-wide neck. The atomic structure of the neck is further obtained using ex situ aberration-corrected scanning TEM imaging. Neck initiation and growth mechanisms are elucidated with density functional theory calculations. Our direct unveiling of the atomic pathways of neck formation during oriented attachment shed light into the fabrication of nanocrystal superlattices with improved structural order and electronic properties.</td>

      <td>The Lorenz number (L) of a conductor is the ratio between its electronic thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity. It takes the Sommerfeld value of L-0 = (pi(2)/3)(k(B)/e)(2) in simple, metallically electronic systems where charge and heat are both carried by the same group of quasi-particles that experience elastic scattering. Higher values of L than L-0 are possible in semiconductors where both electrons and holes co-exist at high densities, that is, in bipolar conduction. As a narrow-bandgap semiconductor, Bi2Te3 exhibits L &gt; L-0 which has been generally attributed to such bipolar conduction mechanisms. However, in this work, we report that L &gt; L-0 is still observed in individual, single-crystal Bi2Te3 nanoribbons even at low temperatures and when degenerately doped, that is, far from the bipolar conduction condition. This discovery calls for different mechanisms to explain the unconventional electronic thermal transport behavior in Bi2Te3. Published under license by AIP Publishing.</td>

      <td>The ability to understand and control the electronic properties of individual molecules in a device environment is crucial for developing future technologies at the nanometre scale and below. Achieving this, however, requires the creation of three-terminal devices that allow single molecules to be both gated and imaged at the atomic scale. We have accomplished this by integrating a graphene field effect transistor with a scanning tunnelling microscope, thus allowing gate-controlled charging and spectroscopic interrogation of individual tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane molecules. We observe a non-rigid shift in the molecule's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (relative to the Dirac point) as a function of gate voltage due to graphene polarization effects. Our results show that electron-electron interactions play an important role in how molecular energy levels align to the graphene Dirac point, and may significantly influence charge transport through individual molecules incorporated in graphene-based nanodevices.</td>

      <td>An electron beam technique can be used to write high-resolution doping patterns in graphene and MoS2 van der Waals heterostructures, and could allow doped circuit designs to be created. A key feature of two-dimensional materials is that the sign and concentration of their carriers can be externally controlled with techniques such as electrostatic gating. However, conventional electrostatic gating has limitations, including a maximum carrier density set by the dielectric breakdown, and ionic liquid gating and direct chemical doping also suffer from drawbacks. Here, we show that an electron-beam-induced doping technique can be used to reversibly write high-resolution doping patterns in hexagonal boron nitride-encapsulated graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) van der Waals heterostructures. The doped MoS2 device exhibits an order of magnitude decrease of subthreshold swing compared with the device before doping, whereas the doped graphene devices demonstrate a previously inaccessible regime of high carrier concentration and high mobility, even at room temperature. We also show that the approach can be used to write high-quality p-n junctions and nanoscale doping patterns, illustrating that the technique can create nanoscale circuitry in van der Waals heterostructures.</td>

      <td>Prediction from the dual-phase nature of superionic conductors-both solid and liquid-like-is that mobile ions in the material may experience reversible extraction-reinsertion by an external electric field. However, this type of pseudoelectroelasticity has not been confirmed in situ, and no details on the microscopic mechanism are known. Here, we in situ monitor the pseudoelectroelasticity of monocrystalline Cu2S nanowires (NWs) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specifically, we reveal the atomic scale details including phase transformation, migration and redox reactions of Cu+ ions, nucleation, growth, as well as spontaneous shrinking of Cu protrusion. Caterpillar-diffusion-dominated deformation is confirmed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation and ab initio calculation, which can be driven by either an external electric field or chemical potential difference. The observed spring-like behavior was creatively adopted for electric nanoactuators. Our findings are crucial to elucidate the mechanism of pseudoelectroelasticity and could potentially stimulate in-depth research into electrochemical and nanoelectromechanical systems.</td>

      <td>Chemical doping can be used to control the charge-carrier polarity and concentration in two-dimensional van der Waals materials. However, conventional methods based on substitutional doping or surface functionalization result in the degradation of electrical mobility due to structural disorder, and the maximum doping density is set by the solubility limit of dopants. Here we show that a reversible laser-assisted chlorination process can be used to create high doping concentrations (above 3 x 10(13) cm(-2)) in graphene monolayers with minimal drops in mobility. The approach uses two lasers-with distinct photon energies and geometric configurations-that are designed for chlorination and subsequent chlorine removal, allowing highly doped patterns to be written and erased without damaging the graphene. To illustrate the capabilities of our approach, we use it to create rewritable photoactive junctions for graphene-based photodetectors. Two laser beams with different energies and configurations can be used to reversibly dope graphene via chlorination and chlorine removal, allowing rewritable graphene photodetectors to be fabricated.</td>

      <td>Porous graphitic framework (PGF) is a two-dimensional (2D) material that has emerging energy applications. An archetype contains stacked 2D layers, the structure of which features a fully annulated aromatic skeleton with embedded heteroatoms and periodic pores. Due to the lack of a rational approach in establishing in-plane order under mild synthetic conditions, the structural integrity of PGF has remained elusive and ultimately limited its material performance. Here, we report the discovery of the unusual dynamic character of the C=N bonds in the aromatic pyrazine ring system under basic aqueous conditions, which enables the successful synthesis of a crystalline porous nitrogenous graphitic framework with remarkable in-plane order, as evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction studies and direct visualization using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The crystalline framework displays superior performance as a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries, outperforming the amorphous counterparts in terms of capacity and cycle stability.</td>

      <td>Bottom-up graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have recently been shown to host nontrivial topological phases. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of deterministic GNR quantum dots whose orbital character is defined by zero-mode states arising from nontrivial topological interfaces. Topological control was achieved through the synthesis and on-surface assembly of three distinct molecular precursors designed to exhibit structurally derived topological electronic states. Using a combination of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we have characterized two GNR topological quantum dot arrangements synthesized under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Our results are supported by density-functional theory and tight-binding calculations, revealing that the magnitude and sign of orbital hopping between topological zero-mode states can be tuned based on the bonding geometry of the interconnecting region. These results demonstrate the utility of topological zero modes as components for designer quantum dots and advanced electronic devices.</td>

      <td>Target Skyrmions (TSks) are extended topological spin textures with a constant chirality where the rotation of the z component of the magnetization is larger than pi. TSks have topological charge 1 or 0, if the z component of the magnetization M-z goes through a rotation of n pi where n is an odd or even integer, respectively. TSks with a rotation of the z component of up to 4 pi have been imaged via high spatial resolution element-specific x-ray imaging. The TSks were generated by weakly coupling 30 nm thin Permalloy (Ni80Fe20, PY) disks with a 1 mu m diameter to asymmetric (Ir 1 nm/Co 1.5 nm/Pt 1 nm) x 7 multilayers that exhibit Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The PY disks stabilize the TSks in the multilayers due to reduced stray field energy and enforced circular symmetry from pinning of domain walls at the edges of the disks. Upon applying external magnetic fields, it is the skyrmion core at the center that ensures stability of the TSk, whereas the collapse of the extended structures in the TSk does not depend on the topological charge.</td>

      <td>Organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) are exploited in the crystallization of microporous materials to tailor the physicochemical properties of the resulting zeolite for applications ranging from separations to catalysis. The rational design of these OSDAs often entails the identification of molecules with a geometry that is commensurate with the channels and cages of the target zeolite structure. Syntheses tend to employ only a single OSDA, but there are a few examples where two or more organics operate synergistically to yield a desired product. Using a combination of state-of-the-art characterization techniques and molecular modeling, we show that the coupling of N,N,N-trimethyl-1,1-adamantammonium and 1,2-hexanediol, each yielding distinct zeolites when used alone, results in the cooperative direction of a third structure, HOU-4, with the mordenite framework type (MOR). Rietveld refinement using synchrotron X-ray diffraction data reveals the spatial arrangement of the organics in the HOU-4 crystals, with amines located in the large channels and alcohols oriented in the side pockets lining the one-dimensional pores. These results are in excellent agreement with molecular dynamics calculations, which predict similar spatial distributions of organics with an energetically favorable packing density that agrees with experimental measurements of OSDA loading, as well as with solid-state two-dimensional Al-27{(29)si}, Al-27{H-1}, and C-13{H-1} NMR correlation spectra, which establish the proximities and interactions of occluded OSDAs. A combination of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy is used to quantify the size of the HOU-4 crystals, which exhibit a platelike morphology, and to index the crystal facets. Our findings reveal that the combined OSDAs work in tandem to produce ultrathin, nonfaulted HOU-4 crystals that exhibit improved catalytic activity for cumene cracking in comparison to mordenite crystals prepared via conventional syntheses. This novel demonstration of cooperativity highlights the potential possibilities for expanding the use of dual structure-directing agents in zeolite synthesis.</td>

      <td>We investigate the influence of dislocations and twin walls in BaTiO3 on its ferroelectric response and the resulting effect on the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of a strain-coupled [Co\Ni](n) film. A dense twinned structure in conjunction with a high dislocation density significantly reduces the converse piezoelectric effect of BaTiO3 by hindering the propagation of newly nucleated domains with an applied electric field. This, in turn, results in a modest reduction of the PMA of the ferromagnetic layer. On the other hand, the ferroelectric polarization reorients from [100] to [001] direction in a dislocation-free BaTiO3, inducing the maximum achievable in-plane compressive strain of 1.1%. A large fraction of this uniaxial strain is transferred to the magnetoelastically coupled ferromagnetic layers whose magnetization switches to in plane via the inverse magnetostriction effect. This work reveals the critical role of the interplay between twin walls and dislocations within a ferroelectric substrate in the performance of multiferroic heterostructures and provides insight into the development of highly energy-efficient magnetoelectric devices.</td>

      <td>Collecting and analyzing the vast amount of information available in the solid-state chemistry literature may accelerate our understanding of materials synthesis. However, one major problem is the difficulty of identifying which materials from a synthesis paragraph are precursors or are target materials. In this study, we developed a two-step chemical named entity recognition model to identify precursors and targets, based on information from the context around material entities. Using the extracted data, we conducted a meta-analysis to study the similarities and differences between precursors in the context of solid-state synthesis. To quantify precursor similarity, we built a substitution model to calculate the viability of substituting one precursor with another while retaining the target. From a hierarchical clustering of the precursors, we demonstrate that the chemical similarity of precursors can be extracted from text data. Quantifying the similarity of precursors helps provide a foundation for suggesting candidate reactants in a predictive synthesis model.y</td>

      <td>Recently, moire superlattices of twisted van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted substantial interest due to their strongly correlated properties. However, the vdW interlayer interaction is intrinsically weak, such that many desired properties can only exist at low temperature. Here, we theoretically predict some unusual properties stemming from the chemical bonding between twisted PbS nanosheets as an example of non-vdW moire superlattices. The strong interlayer coupling in such systems results in giant strain vortices and dipole vortices at the interface. The modified electronic structures become a series of dispersionless bands and artificial-atom states. In real space, these states are analogous to arrays of well-positioned quantum dots, which may be promising for use in single-electron devices. In theory, if the materials are doped with a low concentration of electrons, a Wigner crystal will form even without any magnetic field. To confirm the accessibility and stability of non-vdW moire superlattices in experiment, we synthesized PbS moire superlattices with different twist angles. Our transmission-electron-microscope observations reveal the resemblance of the small-angle-twisted structures with the square matrices of quantum dots, which is in good accordance with our calculations.</td>

      <td>Superconductivity was recently discovered in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) in the absence of a moire potential. Superconductivity is observed proximate to a metallic state with reduced isospin symmetry, but it remains unknown whether this is a coincidence or a key ingredient for superconductivity. Using a Hartree-Fock analysis and constraints from experiments, we argue that the symmetry breaking is inter-valley coherent (IVC) in nature. We evaluate IVC fluctuations as a possible pairing glue, and find that they lead to chiral unconventional superconductivity when the fluctuations are strong. We further elucidate how the inter-valley Hund's coupling determines the spin-structure of the IVC ground state and breaks the degeneracy between spin-singlet and triplet superconductivity. Remarkably, if the normal state is spin-unpolarized, we find that a ferromagnetic Hund's coupling favors spin-singlet superconductivity, in agreement with experiments. Instead, if the normal state is spin-polarized, then IVC fluctuations lead to spin-triplet pairing. Trilayer graphene was recently shown to exhibit superconductivity without a Moire pattern that had proved important in tuning superconductivity in bilayer graphene. Here, the authors explore correlated metallic phases and the pairing mechanism of superconductivity in trilayer graphene, and show that intervalley coherent fluctuations can act as a pairing glue, giving rise to chiral unconventional superconductivity.</td>

      <td>Among many efforts in the research of van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials, increasing the Curie temperature above room temperature has been at the center of research in developing spintronics technology using vdW materials. Here an effective and reliable method of increasing the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 vdW materials by Ga implantation is reported. It is found that implanting Ga into Fe3GeTe2 by the amount of 10(-3) Ga angstrom(-3) could greatly enhance the Fe3GeTe2 Curie temperature by almost 100%. Spatially resolved microdiffraction and element-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy show little changes in the Fe3GeTe2 crystal structure and Fe valence state. In addition, the Ga implantation changes the Fe3GeTe2 magnetization from out-of-plane direction at low temperature to in-plane direction at high temperature. The result opens a new opportunity for tailoring the magnetic properties of vdW materials beyond room temperature.</td>

      <td>To better exploit all-liquid 3D architectures, it is essential to understand dynamic processes that occur during printing one liquid in a second immiscible liquid. Here, the interfacial assembly and transition of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (H6TPPS) over time provides an opportunity to monitor the interfacial behavior of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) during all-liquid printing. The formation of J-aggregates of H4TPPS2- at the interface and the interfacial conversion of the J-aggregates of H4TPPS2- to H-aggregates of H2TPPS4- is demonstrated by interfacial rheology and in situ atomic force microscopy. Equally important are the chromogenic changes that are characteristic of the state of aggregation, where J-aggregates are green in color and H-aggregates are red in color. In all-liquid 3D printed structures, the conversion in the aggregate state with time is reflected in a spatially varying change in the color, providing a simple, direct means of assessing the aggregation state of the molecules and the mechanical properties of the assemblies, linking a macroscopic observable (color) to mechanical properties.</td>

      <td>Perovskites are excellent candidate materials as oxygen carriers in thermochemical processes. Due to their versatile composition, it is possible to fine-tune the perovskite's properties. We present a method for the rational design of AMO(3-) perovskite solid solutions with two different species on the Msite in order to tune their redox behavior. To account for the different ionic radii of different transition metal species M, two distinct ions are used in a solid solution on the A site, allowing tolerance-factor adjusted materials design. Using this methodology, we can create stable perovskites over a large range of different compositions. Leveraging the infrastructure of Materials Project, we calculate redox enthalpies for the reduction of over 240 of these perovskites to their brownmillerite phases based on density functional theory (DFT). We compare this data to experimentally measured data on thermodynamics of 24 of these materials to verify our theoretical framework. An empirical model is formulated for predicting the enthalpy and entropy changes as a function of the perovskites non-stoichiometry , which can be used to simulate the equilibrium composition as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure and to create a perovskite search engine based on an energetic analysis of the redox cycles. The data has been added as a contribution to MPContribs, which now includes publicly available user-controlled interactive graphs based on our theoretical and experimental data.</td>

      <td>An understanding of nanocrystal shape evolution is significant for the design, synthesis, and applications of nanocrystals with surface-enhanced properties such as catalysis or plasmonics. Surface adsorbates that are selectively attached to certain facets may strongly affect the atomic pathways of nanocrystal shape development. However, it is a great challenge to directly observe such dynamic processes in situ with a high spatial resolution. Here, we report the anomalous shape evolution of Ag2O2 nanocrystals modulated by the surface adsorbates of Ag clusters during electron beam etching, which is revealed through in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In contrast to the Ag2O2 nanocrystals without adsorbates, which display the near-equilibrium shape throughout the etching process, Ag2O2 nanocrystals with Ag surface adsorbates show distinct facet development during etching by electron beam irradiation. Three stages of shape changes are observed: a sphere-to-a cube transformation, side etching of a cuboid, and bottom etching underneath the surface adsorbates. We find that the Ag adsorbates modify the Ag2O2 nanocrystal surface configuration by selectively capping the junction between two neighboring facets. They prevent the edge atoms from being etched away and block the diffusion path of surface atoms. Our findings provide critical insights into the modulatory function of surface adsorbates on the shape control of nanocrystals.</td>

      <td>Band structures for electrons, phonons, and other quasiparticles are often an important aspect of describing the physical properties of periodic solids. Most commonly, energy bands are computed along a one-dimensional path of high-symmetry points and line segments in reciprocal space (the k-path), which are assumed to pass through important features of the dispersion landscape. However, existing methods for choosing this path rely on tabulated lists of high-symmetry points and line segments in the first Brillouin zone, determined using different symmetry criteria and unit cell conventions. Here we present a new on-the-fly symmetry-based approach to obtaining paths in reciprocal space that attempts to address the previous limitations of these conventions. Given a unit cell of a magnetic or nonmagnetic periodic solid, the site symmetry groups of points and line segments in the irreducible Brillouin zone are obtained from the total space group. The elements in these groups are used alongside general and maximally inclusive high-symmetry criteria to choose segments for the final k-path. A smooth path connecting each segment is obtained using graph theory. This new framework not only allows for increased flexibility and user convenience but also identifies notable overlooked features in certain electronic band structures. In addition, a more intelligent and efficient method for analyzing magnetic materials is also enabled through proper accommodation of magnetic symmetry.</td>

      <td>Band structure determines the motion of electrons in a solid, giving rise to exotic phenomena when properly engineered. Drawing an analogy between electrons and photons, artificially designed optical lattices indicate the possibility of a similar band modulation effect in graphene systems. Yet due to the fermionic nature of electrons, modulated electronic systems promise far richer categories of behaviors than those found in optical lattices. Here, we uncovered a strong modulation of electronic states in bilayer graphene subject to periodic potentials. We observed for the first time the hybridization of electron and hole sub-bands, resulting in local band gaps at both primary and secondary charge neutrality points. Such hybridization leads to the formation of flat bands, enabling the study of correlated effects in graphene systems. This work may provide a novel way to manipulate electronic states in layered systems, which is important to both fundamental research and application.</td>

      <td>Double perovskite halides are a class of materials with diverse chemistries that are amenable to solution-based synthesis routes, and display a range of properties for a variety of potential applications. Starting from a consideration of the octahedral and tolerance factors of similar to 2000 candidate double perovskite compounds, we compute structural, electronic, and transport properties of similar to 1000 using first-principles calculations based on density-functional-theory methods. The computational results have been assembled in a database that is accessible through the Materials Project online. As one potential application, double perovskites are candidates in the search for lead-free halide photovoltaic absorbers. We present the application of our database to aid the discovery of new double perovskite halide photovoltaic materials, by combining the results with optical absorption and phonon stability calculations. From three distinct classes of chemistries, 11 compounds were identified as promising solar absorbers and the complex chemical trends for band gap within each of these are analyzed, to provide guidelines for the use of substitutional alloying as a means of further tuning the electronic structure. Other possible applications of the database are also discussed.</td>

      <td>High strength in combination with improvements in failure characteristics and associated gains in fracture toughness have placed bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) among the most damage-tolerant materials to date. Recent studies show, however, that there can be large variabilities in the mechanical performance of these alloys, particularly in their toughness, which are likely associated with sample-size effects or structural variations from differences in processing. Here, we examine the variation in fracture toughness of the Pd-based metallic glass Pd77.5Cu6Si16.5, using single-edge notched bend specimens but in two different sizes. Although all toughness results on this glass were valid in terms of the nonlinear elastic fracture mechanics J-standard, i.e., one would expect a single value of the fracture toughness for this alloy, marked differences were apparent in the toughness values and failure characteristics of the differently-sized samples. Specifically, significantly larger variations in toughness values were measured in larger-sized samples, which all essentially failed catastrophically, whereas none of the smaller-sized samples failed catastrophically yet displayed far less scatter in their measured toughness. Additional in situ tests on the smaller-sized samples in a scanning electron microscope revealed stable crack growth and progressive resistance to crack extension, i.e., rising crack-resistance (R-curve) behavior. Overall, this marked transition from brittle catastrophic failure in large samples, where a size-independent fracture toughness can be measured, to non-catastrophic, more ductile (R-curve), behavior in smaller samples, the latter associated with higher toughness, is related to the distinct size-dependent bending ductility and strain-softening behavior in BMGs.

      <td>Combinations of high strength and ductility are hard to attain in metals. Exceptions include materials exhibiting twinning-induced plasticity. To understand how the strength-ductility trade-off can be defeated, we apply in situ, and aberration-corrected scanning, transmission electron microscopy to examine deformation mechanisms in the medium-entropy alloy CrCoNi that exhibits one of the highest combinations of strength, ductility and toughness on record. Ab initio modelling suggests that it has negative stacking-fault energy at 0K and high propensity for twinning. With deformation we find that a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical twin network forms from the activation of three twinning systems. This serves a dual function: conventional twin-boundary (TB) strengthening from blockage of dislocations impinging on TBs, coupled with the 3D twin network which offers pathways for dislocation glide along, and cross-slip between, intersecting TB-matrix interfaces. The stable twin architecture is not disrupted by interfacial dislocation glide, serving as a continuous source of strength, ductility and toughness.</td>

      <td>The local structure of a transition metal (TM) ion is a function of cation elements and valence states. More than that, in this work, by employing a trove of first-principles data of TM oxides, the local structures of TM cations are statistically analyzed to extract detailed information about cation site preference, bond length, site structural distortion, and cation magnetization. It is found that cation radius alone poorly describes the local structure of a transition metal oxide, while the statistics of coordination number as well as the TM-O bond length distribution, especially that of the 3d TMs, can provide comprehensive knowledge for understanding the behavior of TM elements. Based on these statistics, the interplay of site distortion due to the Jahn-Teller effect, cation site similarity, and a new set of ionic radii are all obtained to chart the persona of transition metal ions in solids.</td>

      <td>The crystal phase-based heterostructures of noble metal nanomaterials are of great research interest for various applications, such as plasmonics and catalysis. However, the synthesis of unusual crystal phases of noble metals still remains a great challenge, making the construction of heterophase noble metal nanostructures difficult. Here, we report a one-pot wet-chemical synthesis of well-defined heterophase fcc-2H-fcc gold nanorods (fcc: face-centred cubic; 2H: hexagonal close-packed with stacking sequence of AB) at mild conditions. Single particle-level experiments and theoretical investigations reveal that the heterophase gold nanorods demonstrate a distinct optical property compared to that of the conventional fcc gold nanorods. Moreover, the heterophase gold nanorods possess superior electrocatalytic activity for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction over their fcc counterparts under ambient conditions. First-principles calculations suggest that the boosted catalytic performance stems from the energetically favourable adsorption of reaction intermediates, endowed by the unique heterophase characteristic of gold nanorods. The crystal phase-based heterostructures of noble metal nanomaterials are of interest for various applications. Here, the authors report the wet-chemical synthesis of gold nanorods with a well-defined fcc-2H-fcc heterophase, which possess unique optical and catalytic properties.</td>

      <td>We report an investigation of the pseudo-photocatalytic behavior of rutile TiO2 nanorods for water splitting observed with liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electron beam serves as a light source to initiate the catalytic reaction and a water-in-salt aqueous solution is employed as the electrolyte. The observation reveals that bubbles are generated preferentially residing near the {110} facet of a rutile TiO2 nanorod under a low electron dose rate (9.3-18.6 e(-)/angstrom(2).s). These bubbles are ascribed to hydrogen gas generated from the pseudo-photocatalytic water splitting. As the electron beam current density increases to 93 e(-)/angstrom(2).s, bubbles are also found at the {001} and {111} facets as well as in the bulk liquid solution, demonstrating the dominant effects of water electrolysis by electron beam under higher dose rates. The facet-dependent pseudo-photocatalytic behavior of rutile TiO2 nanorods is further validated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Our work establishes a facile liquid cell TEM setup for the study of pseudo-photocatalytic water splitting and it may also be applied to investigation of other photo-activated phenomena occurring at the solidliquid interfaces.</td>

      <td>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant interest because of their large surface-to-volume ratios and electron confinement. Compared to common 2D materials such as graphene or metal hydroxides, with their intrinsic layered atomic structures, the formation mechanisms of 2D metal oxides with a rocksalt structure are not well understood. Here, we report the formation process for 2D cobalt oxide and cobalt nickel oxide nanosheets, after analysis by in situ liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that three-dimensional (3D) nanoparticles are initially formed from the molecular precursor solution and then transform into 2D nanosheets. Ab initio calculations show that a small nanocrystal is dominated by positive edge energy, but when it grows to a certain size, the negative surface energy becomes dominant, driving the transformation of the 3D nanocrystal into a 2D structure. Uncovering these growth pathways, including the 3D-to-2D transition, provides opportunities for future material design and synthesis in solution.</td>

      <td>The search for materials with flat electronic bands continues due to their potential to drive strong correlation and symmetry breaking orders. Electronic moires formed in van der Waals heterostructures have proved to be an ideal platform. However, there is no holistic experimental picture for how superlattices modify electronic structure. By combining spatially resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with optical spectroscopy, we report the first direct evidence of how strongly correlated phases evolve from a weakly interacting regime in a transition metal dichalcogenide superlattice. By comparing short and long wave vector moires, we find that the electronic structure evolves into a highly localized regime with increasingly flat bands and renormalized effective mass. The flattening is accompanied by the opening of a large gap in the spectral function and splitting of the exciton peaks. These results advance our understanding of emerging phases in moire superlattices and point to the importance of interlayer physics.</td>

      <td>The design and fabrication of 2D nanostructure electrodes with desired electrochemical activities is highly demanded for electrocatalysis and supercapacitors. Herein, the tuned fabrication of ultrathin and tortuous nickel/cobalt-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanosheets via a graphene oxide (GO) surface-confined strategy is reported, yielding nanosheets with a thickness of 1.7-1.8 nm that is duplicated from the graphene oxides in terms of both the lateral size and the shape. It has been found that the C/O functional groups on the GO surface have functioned to promote the oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+, and to transform the beta-phase NiCo-hydroxide (NiCo-OH) into the LDH-phase with tuned homogenous composition and geometry. The ultrathin NiCo-LDH nanosheets mimic the morphology and size of the graphene due to the surface-confined and/or surface-guided growth. The as-obtained NiCo-LDH-graphene (NiCo-LDH-G) nanosheets exhibit a superior electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, evidenced by a small overpotential of 0.337 V (@10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte), and a high charge storage capability of 1489 F g(-1) as electrodes for supercapacitors. This 2D surface-confined growth strategy may pave a way for the fabrication of ultrathin 2D materials including but not limited to transition metal hydroxides for high-performance electrochemical applications.</td>

It is a direct approach to address critical scientific questions on how materials form or transform in response to external stimuli, such as changes in chemical potential, applied electric bias, and interactions with other materials or their environment. Answers to these questions are essential for understanding and controlling nanoscale materials properties and advancing their applications. With the recent technical advances in TEM, such as the development of sample stages, detectors, and image processing toolkits, liquid phase TEM is transforming our ability to characterize materials and revolutionizing our understanding of many fundamental processes in materials science and other fields. In this article, we briefly review the current status, challenges, and opportunities in liquid phase TEM. More details of the development and applications of liquid cell TEM are discussed in the articles in this issue of MRS Bulletin.</td>

      <td>Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are 2D semiconductors with tightly bound excitons and correspondingly strong light-matter interactions. Owing to the weak van der Waals bonding between layers, TMDs can be isolated and stacked together to form synthetic heterostructures with emergent electronic and excitonic properties. In this Review, we focus on the emergent exciton physics in moire superlattices and in TMD heterobilayers coupled to optical cavities, where exciton behaviour can be dramatically modified by the environment. In moire superlattices, a small twist angle or lattice mismatch between the layers introduces a periodic variation in the interlayer alignment that leads to exciton localization, modified optical selection rules and strong correlations. In cavity-heterostructure systems, light-matter interaction is enhanced and exciton states can couple to the cavity to form exciton-polaritons, whose properties depend on the specific TMD layers involved and their alignment. Here, we discuss recent theoretical and experimental progress towards realizing exotic exciton states in TMD heterobilayers and comment on future scientific and technological directions. 2D semiconductor heterostructures host tightly bound exciton states that interact strongly with light. This Review discusses two approaches for realizing emergent excitonic physics in these systems: the introduction of a moire superlattice and the formation of an optical cavity.</td>

      <td>Electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction is central to several energy technologies including electrolyzers, solar fuel generators, and air breathing batteries. Strong acid electrolytes are desirable for many implementations of these technologies, although the deployment of such device designs is often hampered by the lack of non-precious-metal oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, with Ir-based oxides comprising the only known catalysts that exhibit stable activity at low overpotential. During our exploration of the Mn-Sb-O system for precious-metal-free electrocatalysts, we discovered that Mn can be incorporated into the rutile oxide structure at much higher concentrations than previously known, and that these Mn-rich rutile alloys exhibit great catalytic activity with current densities exceeding 50 mA cm(-2) at 0.58 V overpotential and catalysis onset at 0.3 V overpotential. While this activity does not surpass that of IrO2, Pourbaix analysis reveals that the Mn-Sb rutile oxide alloys have the same or better thermodynamic stability under operational conditions. By combining combinatorial composition, structure, and activity mapping with synchrotron X-ray absorption measurements and first principles materials chemistry calculations, we provide a comprehensive understanding of these oxide alloys and identify the critical role of Sb in stabilizing the trivalent Mn octahedra that have been shown to be effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts.</td>

      <td>The ability to tune the electronic properties of molecular arrays is an important step in the development of molecule-scale electronic devices. However, control over internal device charge distributions by tuning interactions between molecules has proved challenging. Here, we show that gate-tunable charge patterning can occur in one-dimensional molecular arrays on graphene field-effect transistors. One-dimensional molecular arrays are fabricated using an edge-templated self-assembly process that allows organic molecules (F(4)TCNQ) to be precisely positioned on graphene devices. The charge configurations of the molecular arrays can be reversibly switched between different collective charge states by tuning the graphene Fermi level via a back-gate electrode. Charge pinning at the ends of the molecular arrays allows the charge state of the entire array to be controlled by adding or removing an edge molecule and changing the total number of molecules in an array between odd and even integers. Charge patterns altered in this way propagate down the array in a cascade effect, allowing the array to function as a charge-based molecular shift register. An extended multi-site Anderson impurity model is used to quantitatively explain this behaviour. One-dimensional molecular arrays on graphene field-effect transistors can be reversibly switched between different periodic charge states by tuning the graphene Fermi level via a back-gate electrode and by manipulating individual molecules, allowing them to function as a nanoscale shift register.</td>

      <td>A bottleneck in efficiently connecting new materials discoveries to established literature has arisen due to an increase in publications. This problem may be addressed by using named entity recognition (NER) to extract structured summary-level data from unstructured materials science text. We compare the performance of four NER models on three materials science datasets. The four models include a bidirectional long shortterm memory (BiLSTM) and three transformer models (BERT, SciBERT, and MatBERT) with increasing degrees of domain-specific materials science pre-training. MatBERT improves over the other two BERTBASE-based models by 1%similar to 12%, implying that domain-specific pre-training provides measurable advantages. Despite relative architectural simplicity, the BiLSTM model consistently outperforms BERT, perhaps due to its domain-specific pre-trained word embeddings. Furthermore, MatBERT and SciBERT models outperform the original BERT model to a greater extent in the small data limit. MatBERT's higher-quality predictions should accelerate the extraction of structured data from materials science literature.</td>

      <td>Solid-liquid-gas reactions are ubiquitous and are encountered in both nature and industrial processes(1-4). A comprehensive description of gas transport in liquid and following reactions at the solid-liquid-gas interface, which is substantial in regard to achieving enhanced triple-phase reactions, remains unavailable. Here, we report a real-time observation of the accelerated etching of gold nanorods with oxygen nanobubbles in aqueous hydrobromic acid using liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that when an oxygen nanobubble is close to a nanorod below the critical distance (similar to 1nm), the local etching rate is significantly enhanced by over one order of magnitude. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that the strong attractive van der Waals interaction between the gold nanorod and oxygen molecules facilitates the transport of oxygen through the thin liquid layer to the gold surface and thus plays a crucial role in increasing the etching rate. This result sheds light on the rational design of solid-liquid-gas reactions for enhanced activities.</td>

      <td>An understanding of solid-liquid interfaces is of great importance for fundamental research as well as industrial applications. However, it has been very challenging to directly image solid-liquid interfaces with high resolution, thus their structure and properties are often unknown. Here, we report a quasi-liquid phase between metal (In, Sn) nanoparticle surfaces and an aqueous solution observed using liquid cell transmission electron microscopy. Our real-time high-resolution imaging reveals a thin layer of liquid-like materials at the interfaces with the frequent appearance of small In nanoclusters. Such a quasi-liquid phase serves as an intermediate for the mass transport from the metal nanoparticle to the liquid. Density functional theory-molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the positive charges of In ions greatly contribute to the stabilization of the quasi-liquid phase on the metal surface. Solid-liquid interfaces are ubiquitous in natural and technological processes, but their imaging at the atomic scale has been challenging.

      <td>Materials that are simultaneously ferromagnetic and ferroelectric - multiferroics - promise the control of disparate ferroic orders, leading to technological advances in microwave magnetoelectric applications and next generation of spintronics. Single-phase multiferroics are challenged by the opposite d-orbital occupations imposed by the two ferroics, and heterogeneous nanocomposite multiferroics demand ingredients' structural compatibility with the resultant multiferroicity exclusively at inter-materials boundaries. Here we propose the two-dimensional heterostructure multiferroics by stacking up atomic layers of ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6 and ferroelectric In2Se3, thereby leading to all-atomic multiferroicity. Through first-principles density functional theory calculations, we find as In2Se3 reverses its polarization, the magnetism of Cr2Ge2Te6 is switched, and correspondingly In2Se3 becomes a switchable magnetic semiconductor due to proximity effect. This unprecedented multiferroic duality (i.e., switchable ferromagnet and switchable magnetic semiconductor) enables both layers for logic applications. Van der Waals heterostructure multiferroics open the door for exploring the low-dimensional magnetoelectric physics and spintronic applications based on artificial superlattices.</td>

      <td>Gold nanoparticles are highly desired for a range of technological applications due to their tunable properties, which are dictated by the size and shape of the constituent particles. Many heuristic methods for controlling the morphological characteristics of gold nanoparticles are well known. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling their size and shape remain poorly understood, partly due to the immense range of possible combinations of synthesis parameters. Data-driven methods can offer insight to help guide understanding of these underlying mechanisms, so long as sufficient synthesis data are available. To facilitate data mining in this direction, we have constructed and made publicly available a dataset of codified gold nanoparticle synthesis protocols and outcomes extracted directly from the nanoparticle materials science literature using natural language processing and text-mining techniques. This dataset contains 5,154 data records, each representing a single gold nanoparticle synthesis article, filtered from a database of 4,973,165 publications. Each record contains codified synthesis protocols and extracted morphological information from a total of 7,608 experimental and 12,519 characterization paragraphs.</td>

      <td>Metallic glasses (MGs) possess remarkably high strength but often display only minimal tensile ductility due to the formation of catastrophic shear bands. Purposely enhancing the inherent heterogeneity to promote distributed flow offers new possibilities in improving the ductility of monolithic MGs. Here, we report the effect of the spatial heterogeneity of elasticity, resulting from the inherently inhomogeneous amorphous structures, on the deformation behavior of MGs, specifically focusing on the ductility using multiscale modeling methods. A highly heterogeneous, Gaussian-type shear modulus distribution at the nanoscale is revealed by atomistic simulations in Cu(64)Zr(36)MGs, in which the soft population of the distribution exhibits a marked propensity to undergo the inelastic shear transformation. By employing a mesoscale shear transformation zone dynamics model, we find that the organization of such nanometer-scale shear transformation events into shear-band patterns is dependent on the spatial heterogeneity of the local shear moduli. A critical spatial correlation length of elastic heterogeneity is identified for the simulated MGs to achieve the best tensile ductility, which is associated with a transition of shear-band formation mechanisms, from stress-dictated nucleation and growth to structure-dictated strain percolation, as well as a saturation of elastically soft sites participating in the plastic flow. This discovery is important for the fundamental understanding of the role of spatial heterogeneity in influencing the deformation behavior of MGs. We believe that this can facilitate the design and development of new ductile monolithic MGs by a process of tuning the inherent heterogeneity to achieve enhanced ductility in these high-strength metallic alloys.</td>

      <td>Engineering layer-layer interactions provides a powerful way to realize novel and designable quantum phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures(1-6). Interlayer electron-electron interactions, for example, have enabled fascinating physics that is difficult to achieve in a single material, such as the Hofstadter's butterfly in graphene/boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures(5-10). In addition to electron-electron interactions, interlayer electron-phonon interactions allow for further control of the physical properties of van der Waals heterostructures. Here we report an interlayer electron-phonon interaction in WSe2/hBN heterostructures, where optically silent hBN phonons emerge in Raman spectra with strong intensities through resonant coupling to WSe2 electronic transitions. Excitation spectroscopy reveals the double-resonance nature of such enhancement, and identifies the two resonant states to be the A exciton transition of monolayer WSe2 and a new hybrid state present only in WSe2/hBN heterostructures. The observation of an interlayer electron-phonon interaction could open up new ways to engineer electrons and phonons for device applications.</td>

      <td>Spin pumping from ferromagnetic Fe into antiferromagnetic CoO across a Ag spacer layer was studied using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in Py/CoO/Ag/Fe/Ag(001). The thin Py film on top of CoO permits an alignment of the CoO Neel vector through field cooling in two otherwise equivalent [110] and [1 (1) over bar0] crystalline axes which are parallel and perpendicular to the Fe magnetization direction, respectively. Fe FMR linewidth is measured as a function of Ag thickness in 10-20-GHz frequency range and in 180-330 K temperature range. We find that there exists an anisotropy in the Fe FMR damping for parallel and perpendicular alignment of the Fe and CoO spins. However, such anisotropic damping exists only at thin Ag thickness where there exists a magnetic interlayer coupling between Fe and CoO, and vanishes at thick Ag thickness where the interlayer coupling becomes negligible but permitting spin-current transmission into CoO. Our result indicates the absence of anisotropic spin current for parallel and perpendicular alignment of the Fe and CoO spin axes.</td>

      <td>To shed light on the formation process and structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on native oxide-terminated silicon wafer anodes from a carbonate-based electrolyte (LP30), we combined in situ synchrotron X-ray reflectivity, linear sweep voltammetry, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and first principles calculations from the Materials Project. We present in situ sub-nanometer resolution structural insights and compositional information of the SEI, as well as predicted equilibrium phase stability. Combining these findings, we observe two well-defined inorganic SEI layers next to the Si anode-a bottom-SEI layer (adjacent to the electrode) formed via the lithiation of the native oxide, and a top-SEI layer mainly consisting of the electrolyte decomposition product LiF. Our study provides novel mechanistic insights into the SEI growth process on Si, and we discuss several important implications regarding ion and electron transport through the SEI layer.</td>

      <td>Excitons in two-dimensional (2D) materials are tightly bound and exhibit rich physics. So far, the optical excitations in 2D semiconductors are dominated by Wannier-Mott excitons, but molecular systems can host Frenkel excitons (FE) with unique properties. Here, we report a strong optical response in a class of monolayer molecular J-aggregates. The exciton exhibits giant oscillator strength and absorption (over 30% for monolayer) at resonance, as well as photoluminescence quantum yield in the range of 60-100%. We observe evidence of superradiance (including increased oscillator strength, bathochromic shift, reduced linewidth and lifetime) at room-temperature and more progressively towards low temperature. These unique properties only exist in monolayer owing to the large unscreened dipole interactions and suppression of charge-transfer processes. Finally, we demonstrate light-emitting devices with the monolayer J-aggregate. The intrinsic device speed could be beyond 30 GHz, which is promising for next-generation ultrafast on-chip optical communications.</td>

      <td>Although significant progress has been made in the self-assembly of nanostructures, present successes heavily rely on precision in building block design, composition, and pair interactions. These requirements fundamentally limit our ability to synthesize macroscopic materials where the likelihood of impurity inclusion escalates and, more importantly, to access molecular-to-nanoscopic-to-microscopic-to-macroscopic hierarchies, since the types and compositions of building blocks vary at each stage. Inspired by biological blends and high-entropy alloys, we hypothesize that diversifying the blend's composition can overcome these limitations. Increasing the number of components increases mixing entropy, leading to the dispersion of different components and, as a result, enhances interphase miscibility, weakens the dependence on specific pair interactions, and enables long-range cooperativity. This hypothesis is validated in complex blends containing small molecules, block copolymer-based supramolecules, and nanoparticles/colloidal particles. Hierarchically structured composites can be obtained with formulation flexibility in the filler selection and blend composition. It is worth noting that, by adding small molecules, we can solve the size constraint that plagues traditional block copolymer/nanoparticle blends. Detailed characterization and simulation further confirm that each component is distributed to locally mediate unfavorable interactions, cooperatively mitigate composition fluctuations, and retain structural fidelity. Furthermore, the blends have sufficient mobility to access tunable microstructures without compromising the order of the nanostructure. Besides establishing a kinetically viable pathway to release current constraints in the composite design and to navigate uncertainties during structure formation over multiple length scales, the present study demonstrates that entropydriven behaviors can be realized in systems beyond high-entropy alloys despite inherent differences between metal alloys and organic/inorganic hybrids.</td>

      <td>A widely used schematic picture of the potential energy landscape (PEL) for liquid and glass gives an impression that the pathway of moving from a valley to another through a saddle point is predetermined. However, in reality the pathway is much more stochastic and unpredictable because thermal history is wiped out at the saddle point and the pathway down is randomly chosen. Here we explain this puzzling behavior through the study of local structural evolutions in the beta relaxation process by atomistic simulations of structural excitations for metallic glasses. We find that the saddle states in the PEL show universal melt-like features in short-range order and atomic dynamics, independent of thermal history and composition. We propose that the short-lived local melting at the saddle point is responsible for wiping out the prior thermal history. This explains why the activation and relaxation stages of the b process are decoupled. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the nature of the saddle states in elucidating the system dynamics, and pose a question on the current view on the system evolution in the PEL.

      <td>Magnetic anisotropy of Permalloy (Py) antidot square lattice was investigated by torquemetry method using Rotation Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (ROTMOKE). We find that there exists a field-dependent 4-fold magnetic anisotropy with the easy magnetization axis along the [11] axis of the antidot square lattice. In addition, there also exists an artifact of a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in ROTMOKE result. We show that both results are due to the period wiggling of the magnetization in space which was confirmed by magnetic imaging using magnetic transmission soft x-ray microscopy (MTXM). Micromagnetic simulation from MuMax3 supports the wiggling structure of the magnetization, as well as reproduces ROTMOKE result. A simplified model was developed based on the periodic wiggling of the magnetization and successfully explored the physical origin of the field-dependent 4-fold anisotropy and the artifact of the uniaxial anisotropy.</td>

      <td>The hafnate perovskites PbHfO3 (antiferroelectric) and SrHfO3 (potential ferroelectric) are studied as epitaxial thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates with the added opportunity of observing a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in the Pb1-xSrxHfO3 system. The resulting (240)-oriented PbHfO3 (Pba2) films exhibited antiferroelectric switching with a saturation polarization approximate to 53 mu C cm(-2) at 1.6 MV cm(-1), weak-field dielectric constant approximate to 186 at 298 K, and an antiferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition at approximate to 518 K. (002)-oriented SrHfO3 films exhibited neither ferroelectric behavior nor evidence of a polar P4mm phase . Instead, the SrHfO3 films exhibited a weak-field dielectric constant approximate to 25 at 298 K and no signs of a structural transition to a polar phase as a function of temperature (77-623 K) and electric field (-3 to 3 MV cm(-1)). While the lack of ferroelectric order in SrHfO3 removes the potential for MPB, structural and property evolution of the Pb1-xSrxHfO3 (0 &lt;= x &lt; 1) system is explored. Strontium alloying increased the electric-breakdown strength (E-B) and decreased hysteresis loss, thus enhancing the capacitive energy storage density (U-r) and efficiency (eta). The composition, Pb0.5Sr0.5HfO3 produced the best combination of E-B = 5.12 +/- 0.5 MV cm(-1), U-r = 77 +/- 5 J cm(-3), and eta = 97 +/- 2%, well out-performing PbHfO3 and other antiferroelectric oxides.</td>

      <td>Formation mechanisms of dendrite structures have been extensively explored theoretically, and many theoretical predictions have been validated for micro- or macroscale dendrites. However, it is challenging to determine whether classical dendrite growth theories are applicable at the nanoscale due to the lack of detailed information on the nanodendrite growth dynamics. Here, we study iron oxide nanodendrite formation using liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We observe seaweed-like iron oxide nanodendrites growing predominantly in two dimensions on the membrane of a liquid cell. By tracking the trajectories of their morphology development with high spatial and temporal resolution, it is possible to explore the relationship between the tip curvature and growth rate, tip splitting mechanisms, and the effects of precursor diffusion and depletion on the morphology evolution. We show that the growth of iron oxide nanodendrites is remarkably consistent with the existing theoretical predictions on dendritic morphology evolution during growth, despite occurring at the nanoscale.</td>

      <td>An experimental study is described on the fracture toughness and micro-mechanisms associated with the initiation and propagation of cracks in metallic nickel containing marked gradients in grain size, ranging from similar to 30 nm to similar to 4 mu m. Specifically, cracks are grown in a gradient structured (GS) nickel with grain-size gradient ranging from the coarse macro-scale to nano-scale (CG -&gt; NG) and vice versa (NG -&gt; CG), with the measured crack-resistance R-curves compared to the corresponding behavior in uniform nano-grained (NG) and coarse-grained (CG) materials. It is found that the gradient structures display a much-improved combination of high strength and toughness compared to uniform grain-sized materials. However, based on J-integral measurements in the gradient materials, the crack-initiation toughness is far higher for cracks grown in the direction of the coarse-to-nano grained gradient than vice versa, a result which we ascribe primarily to excessive crack-tip blunting in the coarse-grained microstructure. Both gradient structures, however, display marked rising R-curve behavior with exceptional crack-growth toughnesses exceeding 200 MPa.m(1/2).</td>

      <td>Moire superlattices in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures form by stacking atomically thin layers on top of one another with a twist angle or lattice mismatch. The resulting Moire potential leads to a strong modification of the band structure, which can give rise to exotic quantum phenomena ranging from correlated insulators and superconductors to Moire excitons and Wigner crystals. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic tuning of Moire potential in a WSe2/WS2 heterostructure at cryogenic temperature. We utilize the optical fiber tip of a cryogenic scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) to locally deform the heterostructure and measure its near-field optical response simultaneously. The deformation of the heterostructure increases the Moire potential, which leads to a red shift of the Moire exciton resonances. We observe the interlayer exciton resonance shifts up to 20 meV, while the intralayer exciton resonances shift up to 17 meV.</td>

      <td>Graphene near charge neutrality is expected to behave like a quantum-critical, relativistic plasma-the Dirac fluid-in which massless electrons and holes collide at a rapid rate. We used on-chip terahertz spectroscopy to measure the frequency-dependent optical conductivity of clean, micrometer-scale graphene at electron temperatures between 77 and 300 kelvin. At charge neutrality, we observed the quantum-critical scattering rate characteristic of the Dirac fluid. At higher doping, we detected two distinct current-carrying modes with zero and nonzero total momenta, a manifestation of relativistic hydrodynamics. Our work reveals the quantum criticality and unusual dynamic excitations near charge neutrality in graphene.</td>

      <td>Light-assisted conversion of CO2 into liquid fuels is one of several possible approaches to combating the rise of carbon dioxide emissions. Unfortunately, there are currently no known materials that are efficient, selective, or active enough to facilitate the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at an industrial scale. In this work, we employ density functional theory to explore potential tellurium-containing photocathodes for the CO2RR by observing trends in adsorption properties arising from over 350 *H, 200 *CO, and 110 *CHO surface-adsorbate structures spanning 39 surfaces of 11 materials. Our results reveal a scaling relationship between *CHO and *H chemisorption energies and charge transfer values, while the scaling relation (typically found in transition metals) between *CO and *CHO adsorption energies is absent. We hypothesize the scaling relation between *H and *CHO to be related to the lone electron located on the bonding carbon atom, while the lack of scaling relation in *CO we attribute to the ability of the lone pair on the C atom to form multiple bonding modes. We compute two predominant orbital-level interactions in the *CO-surface bonds (either using sigma or pi orbitals) in addition to bonding modes involving both sigma and pi interactions using the Crystal Orbital Hamiltonian Population analysis. We demonstrate that bonds involving the C s orbital are more chemisorptive than the C p orbitals of CO. In general, chemisorption trends demonstrate decreased *H competition with respect to *CO adsorption and enhanced *CHO stability. Finally, we uncover simple element-specific design rules with Te, Se, and Ga sites showing increased competition and Zn, Yb, Rb, Br, and Cl sites showing decreased competition for hydrogen adsorption. We anticipate that these trends will help further screen these materials for potential CO2RR performance.</td>

      <td>Computational materials discovery efforts utilize hundreds or thousands of density functional theory calculations to predict material properties. Historically, such efforts have performed calculations at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level of theory due to its efficient compromise between accuracy and computational reliability. However, high-throughput calculations at the higher metaGGA level of theory are becoming feasible. The strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) metaGGA functional offers superior accuracy to GGA across much of chemical space, making it appealing as a general-purpose metaGGA functional, but it suffers from numerical instabilities that impede its use in high-throughput workflows. The recently developed r(2)SCAN metaGGA functional promises accuracy similar to SCAN in addition to more robust numerical performance. However, its performance compared to SCAN has yet to be evaluated over a large group of solid materials. In this paper, we compared r(2)SCAN and SCAN predictions for key properties of approximately 6000 solid materials using a newly developed high-throughput computational workflow. We find that r(2)SCAN predicts formation energies more accurately than SCAN and PBEsol for both strongly and weakly bound materials and that r(2)SCAN predicts systematically larger lattice constants than SCAN. We also find that r(2)SCAN requires modestly fewer computational resources than SCAN and offers significantly more reliable convergence. Thus, our large-scale benchmark confirms that r(2)SCAN has delivered on its promises of numerical efficiency and accuracy, making it a preferred choice for high-throughput metaGGA calculations.</td>

      <td>An antiferromagnetic NiO spiral wall in Fe/NiO/Co0.5Ni0.5O/vicinal Ag(001) was created by rotating Fe magnetization and investigated using x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD). Different from the Mauri's 180 degrees spiral wall, we find that the NiO spiral wall always switches its chirality at similar to 90. rotation of the Fe magnetization, and unwinds the spiral wall back to a single domain with a further rotation of the Fe magnetization from 90 degrees to 180 degrees. The effect of this chirality switching on themagnetic anisotropy was studied using rotationalmagneto-optic Kerr effect (ROTMOKE) on Py/NiO/Co0.5Ni0.5O/vicinal Ag(001). We find that the original Mauri's model has to be corrected by an energy folding due to the chirality switching, which consequently converts the exchange bias from the Mauri's 180 degrees spiral wall into a uniaxial anisotropy and a negative fourfold anisotropy.</td>

      <td>The recent discovery of spin current transmission through antiferromagnetic insulating materials opens up vast opportunities for fundamental physics and spintronics applications. The question currently surrounding this topic is: whether and how could THz antiferromagnetic magnons mediate a GHz spin current? This mismatch of frequencies becomes particularly critical for the case of coherent ac spin current, raising the fundamental question of whether a GHz ac spin current can ever keep its coherence inside an antiferromagnetic insulator and so drive the spin precession of another ferromagnet layer coherently? Utilizing element- and time-resolved x-ray pump-probe measurements on Py/Ag/CoO/Ag/ Fe75Co25/MgO(001) heterostructures, here we demonstrate that a coherent GHz ac spin current pumped by the Py ferromagnetic resonance can transmit coherently across an antiferromagnetic CoO insulating layer to drive a coherent spin precession of the Fe75Co25 layer. Further measurement results favor thermal magnons rather than evanescent spin waves as the mediator of the coherent ac spin current in CoO.</td>

      <td>We present a robust, automatic high-throughput workflow for the calculation of magnetic ground state of solid-state inorganic crystals, whether ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic, and their associated magnetic moments within the framework of collinear spin-polarized Density Functional Theory. This is done through a computationally efficient scheme whereby plausible magnetic orderings are first enumerated and prioritized based on symmetry, and then relaxed and theft energies determined through conventional DFT + U calculations. This automated workflow is formalized using the atomate code for reliable, systematic use at a scale appropriate for thousands of materials and is fully customizable. The performance of the workflow is evaluated against a benchmark of 64 experimentally known mostly ionic magnetic materials of non-trivial magnetic order and by the calculation of over 500 distinct magnetic orderings. A non-ferromagnetic ground state is correctly predicted in 95% of the benchmark materials, with the experimentally determined ground state ordering found exactly in over 60% of cases. Knowledge of the ground state magnetic order at scale opens up the possibility of high-throughput screening studies based on magnetic properties, thereby accelerating discovery and understanding of new functional materials.</td>

      <td>Three compositions of lithium copper phosphates: Li2CuPO4, Li2Cu5(PO4)(4), and Li2CuP2O7 have been studied as potential high-voltage cathode materials for Li-ion batteries, following computational predictions of high operating voltages. An assisted-microwave preparation of Li2CuPO4, which is otherwise difficult to prepare in nearly pure form, has been developed. The electrochemical performance of all three compounds has been investigated. The cyclability of these materials is found to be poor due to structural changes, irreversible reduction to metallic copper at potentials as high as 2.5 V, and the possibility of dissolution into the electrolyte. Some general understanding in regard to the use of Cu compounds in redox electrodes is presented.</td>

      <td>Ultrafast magnetization switching at picosecond and sub-picosecond time scales has tremendous technological potential but still poses numerous questions regarding the underlying quantum mechanical phenomena, including the roles of and interactions between the electrons, spins, and phonons (lattice). At the nanometer-scale dimensions relevant for modern applications, these phenomena become increasingly more pronounced. Until now, helicity-independent all-optical switching (HI-AOS) has been largely limited to amorphous Gd-Fe-Co alloys, for which scaling was challenging due to their relatively low anisotropies. In this work, we demonstrate HI-AOS in amorphous GdCo and scale it to nanometer dimensions while still maintaining uniform out-of-plane magnetization. Single shot HI-AOS is demonstrated in these patterned samples down to a minimum optically detectable magnetic dot size of 200nm. The ultrafast switching behavior was also confirmed using time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements and found to settle to its opposite magnetization state at faster rates for smaller dot diameters, passing a threshold of 75% magnetization reversal within approximately 2 ps for a 200nm dot compared to approximately 40 ps for a 15m pattern. The size dependence of the ultrafast switching is explained in terms of the electron-phonon and spin-lattice interactions.</td>

      <td>The discovery of intrinsic magnetic topological order in MnBi2Te4 has invigorated the search for materials with coexisting magnetic and topological phases. These multiorder quantum materials are expected to exhibit new topological phases that can be tuned with magnetic fields, but the search for such materials is stymied by difficulties in predicting magnetic structure and stability. Here, we compute more than 27,000 unique magnetic orderings for more than 3000 transition metal oxides in the Materials Project database to determine their magnetic ground states and estimate their effective exchange parameters and critical temperatures. We perform a high-throughput band topology analysis of centrosymmetric magnetic materials, calculate topological invariants, and identify 18 new candidate ferromagnetic topological semimetals, axion insulators, and antiferromagnetic topological insulators. To accelerate future efforts, machine learning classifiers are trained to predict both magnetic ground states and magnetic topological order without requiring first-principles calculations.</td>

      <td>Selective adsorption of ligands on nanocrystal surfaces can affect oxidative etching. Here, we report the etching of palladium nanocrystals imaged using liquid cell transmission electron microscopy. The adsorption of surface ligands (i.e., iron acetylacetonate and its derivatives) and their role as inhibitor molecules on the etching process were investigated. Our observations revealed that the etching was dominated by the interplay between palladium facets and ligands and that the etching exhibited different pathways at different concentrations of ligands. At a low concentration of iron acetylacetonate (0.1 mM), rapid etching primarily at {100} facets led to a concave structure. At a high concentration (1.0 mM), the etch rate was decreased owing to a protective film of iron acetylacetonate on the {100} facets and a round nanoparticle was achieved. Ab initio calculations showed that the differences in adsorption energy of inhibitor molecules on palladium facets were responsible for the etching behavior.</td>

      <td>To control the process of cation exchange (CE) in a multielemental system, a detailed understanding of structural changes at the microscopic level is imperative. However, the synthesis of a multielemental system has so far relied on the CE phenomenon of a binary system, which does not necessarily extend to the higher-order systems. Here, direct experimental evidence supported by theoretical calculations reveals a growth model of binary Cu-S to ternary Cu-Sn-S to quaternary Cu-Zn-Sn-S, which shows that cations preferentially diffuse along a specific lattice plane with the preservation of sulfuric anionic framework. In addition, we also discover that, unlike the commonly accepted structure (P6(3)mc), the metastable crystal structure of Cu-Zn-Sn-S phase possesses fixed Sn occupancy sites. By revealing the preferential nature of cations diffusion and growth mechanism, our work provides insight into controlling the stoichiometry and phase purity of novel multielemental materials.</td>

      <td>Moire superlattices provide a powerful way to engineer the properties of electrons and excitons in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures(1-8). The moire effect can be especially strong for interlayer excitons, where electrons and holes reside in different layers and can be addressed separately. In particular, it was recently proposed that the moire superlattice potential not only localizes interlayer exciton states at different superlattice positions, but also hosts an emerging moire quasi-angular momentum (QAM) that periodically switches the optical selection rules for interlayer excitons at different moire sites(9,10). Here, we report the observation of multiple interlayer exciton states coexisting in a WSe2/WS2 moire superlattice and unambiguously determine their spin, valley and moire QAM through novel resonant optical pump-probe spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. We demonstrate that interlayer excitons localized at different moire sites can exhibit opposite optical selection rules due to the spatially varying moire QAM.

      <td>The design of a spin imbalance within the crystallographic unit cell of bottom-up engineered 1D graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) gives rise to nonzero magnetic moments within each cell. Here, we demonstrate the bottom-up assembly and spectroscopic characterization of a one-dimensional Kondo spin chain formed by a chevron-type GNR (cGNR) physisorbed on Au(111). Substitutional nitrogen core doping introduces a pair of low-lying occupied states per monomer within the semiconducting gap of cGNRs. Charging resulting from e the interaction with the gold substrate quenches one electronic state for each monomer, leaving behind a ID chain of radical cations commensurate with the unit cell of the ribbon. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) reveal the signature of a Kondo resonance emerging from the interaction of S = 1/2 spin centers in each monomer core with itinerant electrons in the Au substrate. STM tip lift-off experiments locally reduce the effective screening of the unpaired radical cation being lifted, revealing a robust exchange coupling between neighboring spin centers. First-principles DFT-LSDA calculations support the presence of magnetic moments in the core of this GNR when it is placed on Au.</td>

      <td>Van der Waals heterostructures are synthetic quantum materials composed of stacks of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) layers. Because the electrons in the atomically thin 2D layers are exposed to layer-to-layer coupling, the properties of van der Waals heterostructures are defined not only by the constituent monolayers, but also by the interactions between the layers. Many fascinating electrical, optical and magnetic properties have recently been reported in different types of van der Waals heterostructures. In this Review, we focus on unique excited-state dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterostructures. TMDC monolayers are the most widely studied 2D semiconductors, featuring prominent exciton states and accessibility to the valley degree of freedom. Many TMDC heterostructures are characterized by a staggered band alignment. This band alignment has profound effects on the evolution of the excited states in heterostructures, including ultrafast charge transfer between the layers, the formation of interlayer excitons, and the existence of long-lived spin and valley polarization in resident carriers. Here we review recent experimental and theoretical efforts to elucidate electron dynamics in TMDC heterostructures, extending from timescales of femtoseconds to microseconds, and comment on the relevance of these effects for potential applications in optoelectronic, valleytronic and spintronic devices.</td>

      <td>When independent layers of electrons and holes are in close proximity to each other, their Coulomb interaction allows them to pair into neutral bosons and form an insulating state. This phenomenon is reported in a heterostructure of 2D materials. Moire superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as a powerful tool for engineering quantum phenomena. Here we report the observation of a correlated interlayer exciton insulator in a double-layer heterostructure composed of a WSe2 monolayer and a WS2/WSe2 moire bilayer that are separated by ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride. The moire WS2/WSe2 bilayer features a Mott insulator state when the density of holes is one per moire lattice site. When electrons are added to the Mott insulator in the WS2/WSe2 moire bilayer and an equal number of holes are injected into the WSe2 monolayer, a new interlayer exciton insulator emerges with the holes in the WSe2 monolayer and the electrons in the doped Mott insulator bound together through interlayer Coulomb interactions. The interlayer exciton insulator is stable up to a critical hole density in the WSe2 monolayer, beyond which the interlayer exciton dissociates. Our study highlights the opportunities for realizing quantum phases in double-layer moire systems due to the interplay between the moire flat band and strong interlayer electron interactions.</td>

      <td>Multiple-principal element alloys known as high-entropy alloys have rapidly been gaining attention for the vast variety of compositions and potential combinations of properties that remain to be explored. Of these alloys, one of the earliest, the 'Cantor alloy' CrMnFeCoNi, displays excellent damage-tolerance with tensile strengths of similar to 1 GPa and fracture toughness values in excess of 200 MPa root m; moreover, these mechanical properties tend to further improve at cryogenic temperatures. However, few studies have explored its corresponding fatigue properties. Here we expand on our previous study to examine the mechanics and mechanisms of fatigue-crack propagation in the CrMnFeCoNi alloy (similar to 7 mu m grain size), with emphasis on long-life, near-threshold fatigue behavior, specifically as a function of load ratio at temperatures between ambient and liquid-nitrogen temperatures (293 K-77 K). We find that Delta K-th fatigue thresholds are decreased with increasing positive load ratios, R between 0.1 and 0.7, but are increased at decreasing temperature. These effects can be attributed to the role of roughness-induced crack closure, which was estimated using compliance measurements. Evidence of deformation twinning at the crack tip during fatigue-crack advance was not apparent at ambient temperatures but seen at higher stress intensities (Delta K similar to 20 MPa root m) at 77 K by post mortem microstructural analysis for tests at R = 0.1 and particularly at 0.7. Overall, the fatigue behavior of this alloy was found to be superior, or at least comparable, to conventional cryogenic and TWIP steels such as 304 L or 316 L steels and Fe-Mn steels; these results coupled with the remarkable strength and fracture toughness of the Cantor alloy at low temperatures indicate significant promise for the utility of this material for applications at cryogenic environments.

      <td>Alloying two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors provides a powerful method to tune their physical properties, especially those relevant to optoelectronic applications. However, as the crystal structure becomes more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to accurately correlate response characteristics to detailed atomic structure. We investigate, via annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation, the layered III-VI alloy GaSe0.5Te0.5 as a function of layer number. The local atomic structure and stacking sequence for different layers is explicitly determined. We complement the measurements with first-principles calculations of the total energy and electronic band structure of GaSe0.5Te0.5 for different crystal structures and layer number. The electronic band gap as well as the pi and pi + sigma plasmons are found to be sensitive to layer number.</td>

      <td>Ferrofluids (FFs) can adapt their shape to a magnetic field. However, they cannot maintain their shape when the magnetic field is removed. Here, with a magneto-responsive and reconfigurable interfacial self-assembly (MRRIS) process, we show that FFs can be structured by a magnetic field and maintain their shape, like solids, after removing the magnetic field. The competing self-assembly of magnetic and nonmagnetic nano-particles at the liquid interface endow FFs with both reconfigur-ability and structural stability. By manipulating the external magnetic field, we show that it is possible to write  and erase  the shape of the FFs remotely and repeatedly. To gain an in-depth understanding of the effect of MRRIS on the structure of FFs, we systematically study the shape variation of these liquids under both the static and dynamic magnetic fields. Our study provides a simple yet novel way of manipulating FFs and opens opportunities for the fabrication of all-liquid devices.</td>

      <td>Achieving hierarchical nanomaterials from a bottom-up approach remains challenging. Here, we report a closed-cage, onion nanostructure of covalent organic framework (COF) obtained through a low-temperature solvothermal synthesis. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the atomic arrangement in this COF onion, in which rich nitrogen was uniformly embedded in the periodic porous graphitic framework. The COF onion structure displayed graphitic features at a 0.33 nm interlayer spacing with Van der Waals interactions predominated between the layers. The onion layers exhibited significant heterogeneity in layer stacking by adopting a combination of different stacking modes. Defects were also found, such as five- or seven-member rings deviating from the perfect hexagonal lattice. These geometrical defects resulted in curving the 2D layers, which may have promoted the formation of onion nanostructures through a layer-by-layer attachment. We constructed a corresponding model that predicts COF onion properties. This novel onion exhibited a bandgap value of 2.56 eV, resembling other carbon-based nanomaterials, suggesting potential applications in sensors, photocatalysts, and nanoelectronics.</td>

      <td>Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as promising candidates for spintronics applications, especially after the recent discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in monolayer vdW materials. There has been a critical need for tunable ferromagnetic vdW materials beyond room temperature. Here, we report a real-space imaging study of itinerant ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 and the enhancement of its Curie temperature well above ambient temperature. We find that the magnetic long-range order in Fe3GeTe2 is characterized by an unconventional out-of-plane stripe-domain phase. In Fe3GeTe2 microstructures patterned by a focused ion beam, the out-of-plane stripe domain phase undergoes a surprising transition at 230 K to an in-plane vortex phase that persists beyond room temperature. The discovery of tunable ferromagnetism in Fe3GeTe2 materials opens up vast opportunities for utilizing vdW magnets in room-temperature spintronics devices.</td>

      <td>EXCITONS</td>
      <td>Ultrafast charge transfer processes provide a facile way to create interlayer excitons in directly contacted transition metal dichalcoge-nide (TMD) layers. More sophisticated heterostructures composed of TMD/hBN/TMD enable new ways to control interlayer exciton properties and achieve novel exciton phenomena, such as exciton insulators and condensates, where longer lifetimes are desired. In this work, we experimentally study the charge transfer dynamics in a heterostructure composed of a 1 nm thick hBN spacer between MoSe2 and WSe2 monolayers. We observe the hole transfer from MoSe2 to WSe2 through the hBN barrier with a time constant of 500 ps, which is over 3 orders of magnitude slower than that between TMD layers without a spacer. Furthermore, we observe strong competition between the interlayer charge transfer and intralayer exciton-exciton annihilation processes at high excitation densities. Our work opens possibilities to understand charge transfer pathways in TMD/hBN/TMD heterostructures for the efficient generation and control of interlayer excitons.</td>

      <td>The growth of materials databases has yielded significant quantities of data to mine for new energy materials using high-throughput screening methodologies. One application of interest to energy and optoelectronics is the prediction of new high performing p-type transparent conductors (TCs). However, screening methods for such materials have never been validated over the breadth of computed materials properties. In this study, we compile an experimental data set of 74 bulk crystal structures corresponding to known state-of-the-art n-type and p-type TCs and compute a series of corresponding computational descriptor properties. Our goals are to (1) compare computational descriptors to experimentally demonstrated properties of real materials in the data set, (2) determine the ability of ground state, density functional theory (DFT)-based computational screening methodologies to identify these experimentally realized TCs, and (3) use this understanding to estimate reasonable screening cutoffs for four commonly used descriptors. First, stability calculations demonstrate that most materials in the data set have an energy above the convex hull (E-hull) of &lt;100 meV/atom, and we also propose a Pourbaix analysis technique to estimate moisture stability. Second, we find a lenient cutoff for the DFT PBE band gap of 0.5 eV is sufficient to include a majority of the wide gap candidates and exclude narrow gap compounds. Next, the effective mass, m*, is found to correlate weakly to conductivity in the p-type materials as compared with n-type materials, which may motivate an increase in the m* cutoff as well. Lastly, we perform an uncertainty analysis and literature comparison for the branch point energy (BPE), a qualitative descriptor for dopability. We find the BPEs of most n-type materials to lie near the conduction band and those of most p-type materials to lie at midgap; this is a significant distinction, suggesting BPE to be a more definitive descriptor for n-type TC materials. By assessing the validity of this simple screening methodology via comparing experimental data to computational descriptors, we aim to motivate and strengthen future materials discovery efforts in the field of transparent conductors and beyond.</td>

      <td>Strategies involving metastable phases have been the basis of the design of numerous alloys, yet research on metastable high-entropy alloys is still in its infancy. In dual-phase high-entropy alloys, the combination of local chemical environments and loading-induced crystal structure changes suggests a relationship between deformation mechanisms and chemical atomic distribution, which we examine in here in a Cantor-like Cr20Mn6Fe34Co34Ni6 alloy, comprising both face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal closed packed (hcp) phases. We observe that partial dislocation activities result in stable three-dimensional stacking-fault networks. Additionally, the fraction of the stronger hcp phase progressively increases during plastic deformation by forming at the stacking-fault network boundaries in the fcc phase, serving as the major source of strain hardening. In this context, variations in local chemical composition promote a high density of Lomer-Cottrell locks, which facilitate the construction of the stacking-fault networks to provide nucleation sites for the hcp phase transformation.</td>

      <td>Nanocapsules are hollow nanoscale shells that have applications in drug delivery, batteries, self-healing materials, and as model systems for naturally occurring shell geometries. In many applications, nanocapsules are designed to release their cargo as they buckle and collapse, but the details of this transient buckling process have not been directly observed. Here, we use in situ liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy to record the electron-irradiation-induced buckling in spherical 60-187 nm polymer capsules with similar to 3.5 nm walls. We observe in real time the release of aqueous cargo from these nanocapsules and their buckling into morphologies with single or multiple indentations. The in situ buckling of nanoscale capsules is compared to ex situ measurements of collapsed and micrometer-sized capsules and to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The shape and dynamics of the collapsing nanocapsules are consistent with MC simulations, which reveal that the excessive wrinkling of nanocapsules with ultrathin walls results from their large Foppl-von Karman numbers around 10(5). Our experiments suggest design rules for nanocapsules with the desired buckling response based on parameters such as capsule radius, wall thickness, and collapse rate.</td>

      <td>Using liquid cell TEM, we imaged the formation of CoO nanoparticle rings. Nanoparticles nucleated and grew tracing the perimeter of droplets sitting on the SiNx solid substrate, and finally formed necklace-like rings. By tracking single nanoparticle trajectories during the ring formation and an estimation of the forces between droplets and nanoparticles using a simplified model, we found the junction of liquid nanodroplets with a solid substrate is the attractive site for CoO nanoparticles. Coalescing droplets were capable of pushing nanoparticles to the perimeter of the new droplet and nanoparticles on top of the droplets rolled off toward the perimeter. We propose that the curved surface morphology of the droplets created a force gradient that contributed to the assembly of nanoparticles at the droplet perimeter. Revealing the dynamics of nanoparticle movements and the interactions of nanoparticles with the liquid nanodroplet provides insights on developing novel self-assembly strategies for building precisely defined nanostructures on solid substrates.</td>

      <td>The amorphous iron-germanium system (a-FexGe1-x) lacks long-range structural order and hence lacks a meaningful Brillouin zone. The magnetization of a-FexGe1-x is well explained by the Stoner model for Fe concentrations x above the onset of magnetic order around x = 0.4, indicating that the local order of the amorphous structure preserves the spin-split density of states of the Fe-3d states sufficiently to polarize the electronic structure despite k being a bad quantum number. Measurements reveal an enhanced anomalous Hall resistivity rho(AH)(xy) relative to crystalline FeGe; this rho(AH)(xy) is compared to density-functional theory calculations of the anomalous Hall conductivity to resolve its underlying mechanisms. The intrinsic mechanism, typically understood as the Berry curvature integrated over occupied k states but shown here to be equivalent to the density of curvature integrated over occupied energies in aperiodic materials, dominates the anomalous Hall conductivity of a-FexGe1-x (0.38 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.61). The density of curvature is the sum of spin-orbit correlations of local orbital states and can hence be calculated with no reference to k space. This result and the accompanying Stoner-like model for the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity establish a unified understanding of the underlying physics of the anomalous Hall effect in both crystalline and disordered systems.</td>

      <td>The recent rise of computational, data-driven research has significant potential to accelerate materials discovery. Automated workflows and materials databases are being rapidly developed, contributing to high-throughput data of bulk materials that are growing in quantity and complexity, allowing for correlation between structural-chemical features and functional properties. In contrast, computational data driven approaches are still relatively rare for nanomaterials discovery due to the rapid scaling of computational cost for finite systems. However, the distinct behaviors at the nanoscale as compared to the parent bulk materials and the vast tunability space with respect to dimensionality and morphology motivate the development of data sets for nanometric materials. In this review, we discuss the recent progress in data-driven research in two aspects: functional materials design and guided synthesis, including commonly used metrics and approaches for designing materials properties and predicting synthesis routes. More importantly, we discuss the distinct behaviors of materials as a result of nanosizing and the implications for data-driven research. Finally, we share our perspectives on future directions for extending the current data-driven research into the nano realm.</td>

      <td>Technologically important mechanical properties of engineering materials often degrade at low temperatures. One class of materials that defy this trend are CrCoNi-based medium- and high-entropy alloys, as they display enhanced strength, ductility, and toughness with decreasing temperature. Here we show, using in situ straining in the transmission electron microscope at 93 K (-180 degrees C) that their exceptional damage tolerance involves a synergy of deformation mechanisms, including twinning, glide of partials and full dislocations, extensive cross-slip, and multiple slip activated by dislocation and grain-boundary interactions. In particular, massive cross-slip occurs at the early stages of plastic deformation, thereby promoting multiple slip and dislocation interactions. These results indicate that the reduced intensity of thermal activation of defects at low temperatures and the required increase of applied stress for continued plastic flow, together with high lattice resistance, play a pivotal role in promoting the concurrent operation of multiple deformation mechanisms, which collectively enable the outstanding mechanical properties of these alloys.</td>

      <td>Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures, which usually exist in noncentrosymmetric materials where the crystal inversion symmetry breaking generates the so-called Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This requirement unfortunately excludes many important magnetic material classes, including the recently found two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials, which offer unprecedented opportunities for spintronic technology. Using photoemission electron microscopy and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, we investigated and stabilized Neel-type magnetic skyrmion in vdW ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 on top of (Co/Pd)(n) in which the Fe3GeTe2 has a centrosymmetric crystal structure. We demonstrate that the magnetic coupling between the Fe3GeTe2 and the (Co/Pd)(n) could create skyrmions in Fe3GeTe2 without the need of an external magnetic field. Our results open exciting opportunities in spintronic research and the engineering of topologically protected nanoscale features by expanding the group of skyrmion host materials to include these previously unknown vdW magnets.</td>

Applying these principles to artificial, liquid-based systems has led to reconfigurable materials for soft robotics, actuation, and chemical synthesis. However, progress is limited by a lack of synthetic two-dimensional membranes that exhibit tunable mechanical properties over a comparable range to that seen in nature. Here, we show that the bending modulus, B, of thin assemblies of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the oil-water interface can be varied continuously from sub-kBT to 10(6) kBT, by varying the ligands and particles that comprise the NPS. We find extensive departure from continuum behavior, including enormous mechanical anisotropy and a power law relation between B and the buckling spectrum width. Our findings provide a platform for shape-changing liquid devices and motivate new theories for the description of thin-film wrinkling.</td>

      <td>Epitaxial PbHf1-xTixO3/SrTiO3(001) thin-film heterostructures are studied for a potential morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) akin to that in the PbZr1-xTixO3 system. End members, PbHfO3 and PbTiO3, were found to possess orthorhombic (Pbam) and tetragonal (P4mm) crystal structures and antiferroelectric and ferroelectric (similar to 87 mu C/cm2) behavior, respectively. PbHf0.75Ti0.25O3 and PbHf0.25Ti0.75O3 solid solutions were both found to be ferroelectric with rhombohedral (R3c, similar to 22 mu C/cm2) and tetragonal (P4mm, similar to 46 mu C/ cm2) structures, respectively. For intermediate PbHf1-xTixO3 compositions (e.g., x = 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, and 0.55), a structural transition was observed from rhombohedral (hafnium-rich) to tetragonal (titanium-rich) phases. These intermediate compositions also exhibited mixed phase structures including R3c, monoclinic (Cm), and P4mm symmetries and, in all cases, were ferroelectric with remanent (5-22 mu C/cm2) and saturation (18.5-36 mu C/cm2) polarization and coercive field (24-34.5 kV/cm) values increasing with x. While the dielectric constant was the largest for PbHf0.6Ti0.4O3, the MPB is thought to be near x = 0.5 after separation of the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the dielectric response. Furthermore, piezoelectric displacement-voltage hysteresis loops were obtained for all chemistries revealing displacement values as good as PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 films in the same geometry. Thereby, the PbHf1-xTixO3 system is a viable alternative to the PbZr1-xTixO3 system offering comparable performance.</td>

      <td>We report the nanoscale conductivity imaging of correlated electronic states in angle-aligned WSe2/WS2 heterostructures using microwave impedance microscopy. The noncontact microwave probe allows us to observe the Mott insulating state with one hole per moire unit cell that persists for temperatures up to 150 K, consistent with other characterization techniques. In addition, we identify for the first time a Mott insulating state at one electron per moire unit cell. Appreciable inhomogeneity of the correlated states is directly visualized in the heterobilayer region, indicative of local disorders in the moire superlattice potential or electrostatic doping. Our work provides important insights on 2D moire systems down to the microscopic level.</td>

      <td>Chemical systems may be maintained far from equilibrium by sequestering otherwise reactive species into different microenvironments. It remains a significant challenge to control the amount of chemical energy stored in such systems and to utilize it on demand to perform useful work. Here, we show that redox-active molecules compartmentalized in multiphasic structured-liquid devices can be charged and discharged to power a load on an external circuit. The two liquid phases of these devices feature charge-complementary polyelectrolytes that serve a dual purpose: they generate an ionically conductive coacervate membrane at the liquid-liquid interface, providing structural support; they also mitigate active-material crossover between phases via ion pairing with the oppositely charged anolyte and catholyte active materials.

      <td>High-entropy alloys are a class of materials that contain five or more elements in near-equiatomic proportions(1,2). Their unconventional compositions and chemical structures hold promise for achieving unprecedented combinations of mechanical properties(3-8). Rational design of such alloys hinges on an understanding of the composition-structure-property relationships in a near-infinite compositional space(9,10). Here we use atomic-resolution chemical mapping to reveal the element distribution of the widely studied face-centred cubic CrMnFeCoNi Cantor alloy(2) and of a new face-centred cubic alloy, CrFeCoNiPd. In the Cantor alloy, the distribution of the five constituent elements is relatively random and uniform. By contrast, in the CrFeCoNiPd alloy, in which the palladium atoms have a markedly different atomic size and electronegativity from the other elements, the homogeneity decreases considerably; all five elements tend to show greater aggregation, with a wavelength of incipient concentration waves(11,12) as small as 1 to 3 nanometres. The resulting nanoscale alternating tensile and compressive strain fields lead to considerable resistance to dislocation glide. In situ transmission electron microscopy during straining experiments reveals massive dislocation cross-slip from the early stage of plastic deformation, resulting in strong dislocation interactions between multiple slip systems. These deformation mechanisms in the CrFeCoNiPd alloy, which differ markedly from those in the Cantor alloy and other face-centred cubic high-entropy alloys, are promoted by pronounced fluctuations in composition and an increase in stacking-fault energy, leading to higher yield strength without compromising strain hardening and tensile ductility. Mapping atomic-scale element distributions opens opportunities for understanding chemical structures and thus providing a basis for tuning composition and atomic configurations to obtain outstanding mechanical properties.</td>

      <td>Interfacing nanomechanics with photonics and charge/spin-based electronics has transformed information technology and facilitated fundamental searches for the quantum-to-classical transition(1-3). Utilizing the electron valley degree of freedom as an information carrier, valleytronics has recently emerged as a promising platform for developments in computation and communication(4-7). Thus far, explorations of valleytronics have focused on optoelectronic and magnetic means(8-16). Here, we realize valley-mechanical coupling in a resonator made of the monolayer semiconductor MoS2 and transduce valley information into mechanical states. The coupling is achieved by exploiting the magnetic moment of valley carriers with a magnetic field gradient. We optically populate the valleys and observe the resulting mechanical actuation using laser interferometry. We are thus able to control the valley-mechanical interaction by adjusting the pump-laser light, the magnetic field gradient and temperature. Our work paves the way for realizing valley-actuated devices and hybrid valley quantum systems.</td>

      <td>PbSe nanocrystals have attracted widespread attention due to a variety of potential applications. However, the practical utility of these nanocrystals has been hindered by their poor air stability, which induces undesired changes in the optical and electronic properties. An understanding of the degradation of PbSe nanocrystals when they are exposed to air is critical for improving the stability and enhancing their applications. Here, we use in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an environmental cell connected to air to study PbSe nanocrystal degradation triggered by air exposure. We have also conducted a series of complementary studies, including in situ environmental TEM study of PbSe nanocrystals exposed to pure oxygen and PbSe nanocrystals in H2O using a liquid cell, and ex situ experiments, such as O-2 plasma treatment and thermal heating of PbSe nanocrystals under different air exposure. Our in situ observations reveal that when PbSe nanocrystals are exposed to air (or oxygen) under electron beam irradiation, they experience a series of changes, including shape evolution of individual nanocrystals with the cuboid intermediates, coalescence between nanocrystals, and formation of PbSe thin films through drastic solid-state fusion. Further studies show that the PbSe thin films transform into an amorphous Pb rich phase or eventually pure Pb, which suggest that Se reacts with oxygen and can be evaporated under electron beam illumination. These various in situ and ex situ experimental results indicate that PbSe nanocrystal degradation in air is initiated by the dissociation and removal of ligands from the PbSe nanocrystal surface.</td>

      <td>Among topological solitons, magnetic skyrmions are two-dimensional particle-like objects with a continuous winding of the magnetization, and magnetic Hopfions are three-dimensional objects that can be formed from a closed loop of twisted skyrmion strings. Theoretical models suggest that magnetic Hopfions can be stabilized in frustrated or chiral magnetic systems, and target skymions can be transformed into Hopfions by adapting their perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, but their experimental verification has been elusive so far. Here, we present an experimental study of magnetic Hopfions that are created in Ir/Co/Pt multilayers shaped into nanoscale disks, known to host target skyrmions. To characterize three-dimensional spin textures that distinguish Hopfions from target skyrmions magnetic images are recorded with surface-sensitive X-ray photoemission electron microscopy and bulk-sensitive soft X-ray transmission microscopy using element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism effects as magnetic contrast. These results could stimulate further investigations of Hopfions and their potential application in three-dimensional spintronics devices. In three dimensions, magnetic Skyrmions can form extended strings. By connecting the ends of a Skyrmionic string, a magnetic Hopfion is formed. Here, the authors present experimental evidence for the appearance of Hopfions, a topological soliton defined by a Hopf number, in a magnetic system.</td>

      <td>Floquet states, where a periodic optical field coherently drives electrons in solids(1-3), can enable novel quantum states of matter(4-6). A prominent approach to realize Floquet states is based on the optical Stark effect. Previous studies on the optical Stark effect often treated the excited state in solids as free quasi-particles(3,7-12). However, exciton-exciton interactions can be sizeably enhanced in low-dimensional systems and may lead to light-matter interactions that are qualitatively different from those in the non-interacting picture. Here we use monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) as a model system to demonstrate that the driving optical field can couple a hierarchy of excitonic states, and the many-body inter-valley biexciton state plays a dominant role in the optical Stark effect. Specifically, the exciton-biexciton coupling in monolayer MoSe2 breaks down the valley selection rules based on the non-interacting exciton picture. The photon-dressed excitonic states exhibit an energy redshift, splitting or blueshift as the driving photon frequency varies below the exciton transition. We determine a binding energy of 21 meV for the inter-valley biexciton and a transition dipole moment of 9.3 debye for the exciton-biexciton transition. Our study reveals the crucial role of many-body effects in coherent light-matter interaction in atomically thin two-dimensional materials.</td>

      <td>Merons which are topologically equivalent to one-half of skyrmions can exist only in pairs or groups in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) systems. The recent discovery of meron lattice in chiral magnet Co8Zn9Mn3 raises the immediate challenging question that whether a single meron pair, which is the most fundamental topological structure in any 2D meron systems, can be created and stabilized in a continuous FM film? Utilizing winding number conservation, we develop a new method to create and stabilize a single pair of merons in a continuous Py film by local vortex imprinting from a Co disk. By observing the created meron pair directly within a magnetic field, we determine its topological structure unambiguously and explore the topological effect in its creation and annihilation processes. Our work opens a pathway towards developing and controlling topological structures in general magnetic systems without the restriction of perpendicular anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.</td>

      <td>The behavior of individual nanocrystals during superlattice phase transitions can profoundly affect the structural perfection and electronic properties of the resulting superlattices. However, details of nanocrystal morphological changes during superlattice phase transitions are largely unknown due to the lack of direct observation. Here, we report the dynamic deformability of PbSe semiconductor nanocrystals during superlattice phase transitions that are driven by ligand displacement. Real-time high-resolution imaging with liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy reveals that following ligand removal, the individual PbSe nanocrystals experience drastic directional shape deformation when the spacing between nanocrystals reaches 2 to 4 nm. The deformation can be completely recovered when two nanocrystals move apart or it can be retained when they attach. The large deformation, which is responsible for the structural defects in the epitaxially fused nanocrystal superlattice, may arise from internanocrystal dipole-dipole interactions.</td>

      <td>While powder diffraction methods are routinely utilized to optimize structural models for compounds whose crystal structures are known, the determination of unknown structures is far more challenging. When the unknown structure is large, structure solution can become a virtually intractable problem using standard structure solution methodologies, especially when the space group cannot be unambiguously resolved. One such system is the promising Na-ion battery cathode material Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3, whose high-temperature and room-temperature structures were previously solved, but whose more complex low-temperature structure could not be determined. Here, a novel materials genomic approach is demonstrated for the solution of the unknown 100 K structure of Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3 in which enumeration methods are first used to generate a large number (similar to 3000) of trial structures based on plausible orderings of Na ions and then automated Rietveld refinements are carried out to optimize each of these trial structures. Based on both the analysis of the ensemble of optimized trial structures and the density functional theory energy minimization of selected trial structures, the 100 K structure of Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3 is best described as belonging to the space group A2(1)am with unit cell dimensions of a = 9.01928(4), b = 27.1379(1), and c = 10.73307(5). The 100 K unit cell has a large volume of 2627.07(2) angstrom(3) with Z = 12 and 33 independent crystallographic sites (9 Na, 3 V, 3 P, 12 O, and 6 F) that is 3x and 6x larger than the room- and high-temperature polymorphs of this phase, respectively. The novel methods described here will be generally applicable for the solution of the complex cation-ordered structures that commonly occur for battery materials.</td>

      <td>Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and ab initio simulations reveal buckling reconstruction and in-plane strain redistribution in WSe2/WS2 moire heterostructures. Moire superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures can host novel correlated quantum phenomena due to the interplay of narrow moire flat bands and strong, long-range Coulomb interactions(1-9). However, microscopic knowledge of the atomically reconstructed moire superlattice and resulting flat bands is still lacking, which is critical for fundamental understanding and control of the correlated moire phenomena. Here we quantitatively study the moire flat bands in three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed WSe2/WS2 moire superlattices by comparing scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) of high-quality exfoliated TMD heterostructure devices with ab initio simulations of TMD moire superlattices. A strong 3D buckling reconstruction accompanied by large in-plane strain redistribution is identified in our WSe2/WS2 moire heterostructures. STS imaging demonstrates that this results in a remarkably narrow and highly localized K-point moire flat band at the valence band edge of the heterostructure. A series of moire flat bands are observed at different energies that exhibit varying degrees of localization. Our observations contradict previous simplified theoretical models but agree quantitatively with ab initio simulations that fully capture the 3D structural reconstruction. Our results reveal that the strain redistribution and 3D buckling in TMD heterostructures dominate the effective moire potential and the corresponding moire flat bands at the Brillouin zone K points.</td>

      <td>Electric-field control of magnetism requires deterministic control of the magnetic order and understanding of the magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroics like BiFeO3 and EuTiO3. Despite this critical need, there are few studies on the strain evolution of magnetic order in BiFeO3 films. Here, in (110)-oriented BiFeO3 films, we reveal that while the polarization structure remains relatively unaffected, strain can continuously tune the orientation of the antiferromagnetic-spin axis across a wide angular space, resulting in an unexpected deviation of the classical perpendicular relationship between the antiferromagnetic axis and the polarization. Calculations suggest that this evolution arises from a competition between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and single-ion anisotropy wherein the former dominates at small strains and the two are comparable at large strains. Finally, strong coupling between the BiFeO3 and the ferromagnet Co0.9Fe0.1 exists such that the magnetic anisotropy of the ferromagnet can be effectively controlled by engineering the orientation of the antiferromagnetic-spin axis.</td>

      <td>The realization of long-range ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional van der Waals crystals, combined with their rich electronic and optical properties, could lead to new magnetic, magnetoelectric and magneto-optic applications(1-4). In two-dimensional systems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly suppressed by thermal fluctuations, according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem(5); however, these thermal fluctuations can be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy. Previous efforts, based on defect and composition engineering(6-10), or the proximity effect, introduced magnetic responses only locally or extrinsically. Here we report intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers, as revealed by scanning magneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In this magnetically soft, two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet, we achieve unprecedented control of the transition temperature (between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states) using very small fields (smaller than 0.3 tesla). This result is in contrast to the insensitivity of the transition temperature to magnetic fields in the three-dimensional regime. We found that the small applied field leads to an effective anisotropy that is much greater than the near-zero magnetocrystalline anisotropy, opening up a large spin-wave excitation gap. We explain the observed phenomenon using renormalized spin-wave theory and conclude that the unusual field dependence of the transition temperature is a hallmark of soft, two-dimensional ferromagnetic van der Waals crystals. Cr2Ge2Te6 is a nearly ideal two-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet and so will be useful for studying fundamental spin behaviours, opening the door to exploring new applications such as ultra-compact spintronics.</td>

      <td>Some quantum spin liquids are expected to have an effective Fermi surface of fractionalized spinon excitations. The two-dimensional spin liquid candidate 1T-TaSe2 has charge density modulations that may be caused by an unstable spinon Fermi surface. Two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnets are predicted under some conditions to exhibit a quantum spin liquid ground state with no energy barrier to create emergent, fractionalized spinon excitations that carry spin but no charge. Materials that realize this kind of spin liquid are expected to have a low-energy behaviour described by a spinon Fermi surface. Directly imaging the resulting spinons, however, is difficult due to their chargeless nature. Here we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to image density waves consistent with the predictions of spinon density modulation arising from a spinon Fermi surface instability in single-layer 1T-TaSe2. We confirm the existence of a triangular lattice of localized spins in this material by contacting it with a metallic 1H-TaSe2 substrate and measuring the Kondo effect. Spectroscopic imaging of isolated single-layer 1T-TaSe2 reveals long-wavelength super-modulations at Hubbard band energies, consistent with the predicted behaviour of itinerant spinons. These super-modulations allow the direct experimental measurement of the spinon Fermi wavevector, in good agreement with theoretical predictions for a two-dimensional quantum spin liquid.</td>

In this work, we perform ab initio calculations of the full phonon dispersion and vibrational density of states for 1521 semiconductor compounds in the harmonic approximation based on density functional perturbation theory.

      <td>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with efficient charge transport and exceptional chemical stability are emerging as an import class of semiconducting materials for opto-/electronic devices and energy-related applications. However, the limited synthetic chemistry to access such materials and the lack of mechanistic understanding of carrier mobility greatly hinder their practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of three chemically stable polyarylether-based metallophthalocyanine COFs (PAE-PcM, M = Cu, Ni, and Co) and facile in situ growth of their thin films on various substrates (i.e., SiO2/Si, ITO, quartz) under solvothermal conditions. We show that PAE-PcM COFs thin films with van der Waals layered structures exhibit p-type semiconducting properties with the intrinsic mobility up to similar to 19.4 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 4 orders of magnitude of increase in conductivity for PAE-PcCu film (0.2 S m(-1)) after iodine doping. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the carrier transport in the framework is anisotropic, with the out-of-plane hole transport along columnar stacked phthalocyanine more favorable. Furthermore, PAE-PcCo shows the redox behavior maximumly contributes similar to 88.5% of its capacitance performance, giving rise to a high surface area normalized capacitance of similar to 19 mu F cm(-2). Overall, this work not only offers fundamental understandings of electronic properties of polyarylether-based 2D COFs but also paves the way for their energy-related applications.</td>

      <td>Motivated by recent experimental observations of correlated metallic phases and superconductivity in rhombo-hedral trilayer graphene (RTG), we perform an unbiased study of electronic ordering instabilities in hole-doped RTG. Specifically, we focus on electronic states energetically proximate to Van Hove singularities (VHSs), where a large density of states promotes different interaction-induced symmetry-breaking electronic orders. To resolve the Fermi surface near VHSs, we construct a fermionic hot-spot model and demonstrate that a perpendicular electric field can tune different nesting structures of the Fermi surface. Subsequently, we apply a renormalization group analysis to describe the low-energy phase diagrams of our model under both short-range repulsive interactions as well as realistic (long-range) Coulomb interactions. Our analysis shows instabilities towards either intervalley coherent metallic phases or superconducting phases. The dominant pairing channel depends crucially on the nature of Fermi surface nesting-repulsive Coulomb interaction favors spin-singlet d-wave pairing for relatively small displacement field and spin-singlet i-wave pairing for larger displacement field. We argue that the phase diagram of RTG can be well-understood by modeling the realistic Coulomb interaction as the sum of repulsive density-density interaction and ferromagnetic spin-triplet intervalley coherence (IVC) Hund's coupling, while phonon-mediated electronic interactions have a negligible effect on this system, in sharp contrast to twisted graphene multilayers.</td>

      <td>Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI(3)) is attractive for photovoltaic devices due to its optimal bandgap at around 1.45 eV and improved thermal stability compared with methylammonium-based perovskites. Crystallization of phase-pure alpha-FAPbI(3) conventionally requires high-temperature thermal annealing at 150 degrees C whilst the obtained alpha-FAPbI(3) is metastable at room temperature. Here, aerosol-assisted crystallization (AAC) is reported, which converts yellow delta-FAPbI(3) into black alpha-FAPbI(3) at only 100 degrees C using precursor solutions containing only lead iodide and formamidinium iodide with no chemical additives. The obtained alpha-FAPbI(3) exhibits remarkably enhanced stability compared to the 150 degrees C annealed counterparts, in combination with improvements in film crystallinity and photoluminescence yield. Using X-ray diffraction, X-ray scattering, and density functional theory simulation, it is identified that relaxation of residual tensile strains, achieved through the lower annealing temperature and post-crystallization crystal growth during AAC, is the key factor that facilitates the formation of phase-stable alpha-FAPbI(3). This overcomes the strain-induced lattice expansion that is known to cause the metastability of alpha-FAPbI(3). Accordingly, pure FAPbI(3) p-i-n solar cells are reported, facilitated by the low-temperature (&lt;= 100 degrees C) AAC processing, which demonstrates increases of both power conversion efficiency and operational stability compared to devices fabricated using 150 degrees C annealed films.</td>

      <td>The colour centre platform holds promise for quantum technologies, and hexagonal boron nitride has attracted attention due to the high brightness and stability, optically addressable spin states and wide wavelength coverage discovered in its emitters. However, its application is hindered by the typically random defect distribution and complex mesoscopic environment. Here, employing cathodoluminescence, we demonstrate on-demand activation and control of colour centre emission at the twisted interface of two hexagonal boron nitride flakes. Further, we show that colour centre emission brightness can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude by tuning the twist angle. Additionally, by applying an external voltage, nearly 100% brightness modulation is achieved. Our ab initio GW and GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations suggest that the emission is correlated to nitrogen vacancies and that a twist-induced moire potential facilitates electron-hole recombination. This mechanism is further exploited to draw nanoscale colour centre patterns using electron beams. Colour centre emission from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) holds promise for quantum technologies but activation and tuning are challenging. Here, the authors show twist-angle emission brightness tuning and external voltage brightness modulation at the twisted interface of hBN flakes.</td>

      <td>Transition metal dichalcogenide materials are unique in the wide variety of structural and electronic phases they exhibit in the two-dimensional limit. Here we show how such polymorphic flexibility can be used to achieve topological states at highly ordered phase boundaries in a new quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), 1T'-WSe2. We observe edge states at the crystallographically aligned interface between a quantum spin Hall insulating domain of 1T'-WSe2 and a semiconducting domain of 1H-WSe2 in contiguous single layers. The QSHI nature of single-layer 1T'-WSe2 is verified using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to determine band inversion around a 120 meV energy gap, as well as scanning tunneling spectroscopy to directly image edge-state formation. Using this edge-state geometry we confirm the predicted penetration depth of one-dimensional interface states into the two-dimensional bulk of a QSHI for a well-specified crystallographic direction. These interfaces create opportunities for testing predictions of the microscopic behavior of topologically protected boundary states.</td>

      <td>Chiral magnetic domains are topological spin textures in which the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction assigns a given chirality to the domain walls. Notably, despite rapid progress in chiral magnetic research, one fundamental issue that remains unclear is how the chirality of chiral magnetic domains change as a magnetic field deforms the spin texture. Using spin-polarized low energy electron microscopy, the evolution of Fe/Ni chiral magnetic stripe domains are investigated in single-crystalline Fe/Ni/Cu/Co/Cu(001) multilayers in which the interlayer magnetic coupling between the Co and Fe/Ni films serves as an in-plane magnetic field. Contrary to theoretical works, it is found that the chirality of the Neel walls results in a parallel alignment of the magnetic stripes with the in-plane magnetic field direction. The transformation of chiral Neel walls into achiral Bloch walls can be precisely controlled by tuning the Cu spacer layer thickness. In addition, the domain wall exhibits a spontaneous asymmetry within the in-plane magnetic field, leading to an unbalanced chirality between the left-handed and right-handed Bloch walls. These new results foster a better understanding of the chiral domain properties within a magnetic field.</td>

      <td>An understanding of lithium stripping is as important as that of lithium plating to achieve significant advances in using lithium metal anodes for high-energy rechargeable batteries. However, there have been limited studies on lithium stripping compared to lithium plating. Here we report the lithium stripping mechanisms revealed through in-situ electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We directly observe and compare the stripping behavior of the in-situ grown lithium dendrites and lithium nanograins covered by a lithium fluoride-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). We find the sporadic lithium stripping behavior and three important modes that can describe the stripping of individual lithium deposits, regardless of their morphology: (i) symmetric stripping, (ii) surface-preferred asymmetric stripping, and (iii) interface-preferred asymmetric stripping. In addition, SEI chemical mapping with high spatial resolution shows a remarkable SEI loss at the end of the lithium metal stripping, which illustrates the importance of SEI protection in the subsequent cycles.</td>

      <td>We investigate the electronic structure of the fiat bands induced by moire superlattices and electric fields in nearly aligned ABC trilayer graphene (TLG) boron-nitride (BN) interfaces where Coulomb effects can lead to correlated gapped phases. Our calculations indicate that valley-spin resolved isolated superlattice flat bands that carry a finite Chern number C = 3 proportional to the layer number can appear near charge neutrality for appropriate perpendicular electric fields and twist angles. When the degeneracy of the bands is lifted by Coulomb interactions, these topological bands can lead to anomalous quantum Hall phases that embody orbital and spin magnetism. Narrow bandwidths of similar to 10 meV achievable for a continuous range of twist angles theta less than or similar to 0.6 degrees with moderate interlayer potential differences of similar to 50 meV make the TLG-BN systems a promising platform for the study of electric-field tunable Coulomb-interaction-driven spontaneous Hall phases.</td>

      <td>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are promising for spintronic and valleytronic applications because valley-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized photons and the valley and spin degrees of freedom are locked by strong spin-orbital interactions. In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked spin-valley diffusion current in tungsten disulfide (WS2)-tungsten diselenide (WSe2) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the propagation of valley current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field-free generation of a locked spin-valley current in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in spin and valley devices.</td>

      <td>In two-dimensional layered quantum materials, the stacking order of the layers determines both the crystalline symmetry and electronic properties such as the Berry curvature, topology and electron correlation(1-4). Electrical stimuli can influence quasiparticle interactions and the free-energy landscape(5,6), making it possible to dynamically modify the stacking order and reveal hidden structures that host different quantum properties. Here, we demonstrate electrically driven stacking transitions that can be applied to design non-volatile memory based on Berry curvature in few-layer WTe2. The interplay of out-of-plane electric fields and electrostatic doping controls in-plane interlayer sliding and creates multiple polar and centrosymmetric stacking orders. In situ nonlinear Hall transport reveals that such stacking rearrangements result in a layer-parity-selective Berry curvature memory in momentum space, where the sign reversal of the Berry curvature and its dipole only occurs in odd-layer crystals. Our findings open an avenue towards exploring coupling between topology, electron correlations and ferroelectricity in hidden stacking orders and demonstrate a new low-energy-cost, electrically controlled topological memory in the atomically thin limit. A memory device is proposed that uses a dynamical modification of the stacking order of few-layer WTe(2)to encode information. The change in stacking modifies both the Berry curvature and the Hall transport, allowing two states to be distinguished.</td>

      <td>As materials data sets grow in size and scope, the role of data mining and statistical learning methods to analyze these materials data sets and build predictive models is becoming more important. This manuscript introduces matminer, an open-source, Python-based software platform to facilitate data-driven methods of analyzing and predicting materials properties. Matminer provides modules for retrieving large data sets from external databases such as the Materials Project, Citrination, Materials Data Facility, and Materials Platform for Data Science. It also provides implementations for an extensive library of feature extraction routines developed by the materials community, with 47 featurization classes that can generate thousands of individual descriptors and combine them into mathematical functions. Finally, matminer provides a visualization module for producing interactive, shareable plots. These functions are designed in a way that integrates closely with machine learning and data analysis packages already developed and in use by the Python data science community. We explain the structure and logic of matminer, provide a description of its various modules, and showcase several examples of how matminer can be used to collect data, reproduce data mining studies reported in the literature, and test new methodologies.</td>

      <td>Moire superlattices enable the generation of new quantum phenomena in two-dimensional heterostructures, in which the interactions between the atomically thin layers qualitatively change the electronic band structure of the superlattice. For example, mini-Dirac points, tunable Mott insulator states and the Hofstadter butterfly pattern can emerge in different types of graphene/boron nitride moire superlattices, whereas correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been reported in twisted bilayer graphene moire superlattices(1-12). In addition to their pronounced effects on single-particle states, moire superlattices have recently been predicted to host excited states such as moire exciton bands(13-15). Here we report the observation of moire superlattice exciton states in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe2/WS2) heterostructures in which the layers are closely aligned. These moire exciton states manifest as multiple emergent peaks around the original WSe2 A exciton resonance in the absorption spectra, and they exhibit gate dependences that are distinct from that of the A exciton in WSe2 monolayers and in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures with large twist angles. These phenomena can be described by a theoretical model in which the periodic moire potential is much stronger than the exciton kinetic energy and generates multiple flat exciton minibands. The moire exciton bands provide an attractive platform from which to explore and control excited states of matter, such as topological excitons and a correlated exciton Hubbard model, in transitionmetal dichalcogenides.</td>

      <td>Photoelectrochemical fuel generation is a promising route to sustainable liquid fuels produced from water and captured carbon dioxide with sunlight as the energy input. Development of these technologies requires photoelectrode materials that are both photocatalytically active and operationally stable in harsh oxidative and/or reductive electrochemical environments. Such photocatalysts can be discovered based on co-design principles, wherein design for stability is based on the propensity for the photocatalyst to self-passivate under operating conditions and design for photoactivity is based on the ability to integrate the photocatalyst with established semiconductor substrates. Here, we report on the synthesis and characterization of zinc titanium nitride (ZnTiN2) that follows these design rules by having a wurtzite-derived crystal structure and showing self-passivating surface oxides created by electrochemical polarization. The sputtered ZnTiN2 thin films have optical absorption onsets below 2 eV and n-type electrical conduction of 3 S/cm. The band gap of this material is reduced from the 3.36 eV theoretical value by cation-site disorder, and the impact of cation antisites on the band structure of ZnTiN2 is explored using density functional theory. Under electrochemical polarization, the ZnTiN2 surfaces have TiO2- or ZnO-like character, consistent with Materials Project Pourbaix calculations predicting the formation of stable solid phases under near-neutral pH. These results show that ZnTiN2 is a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical liquid fuel generation and demonstrate a new materials design approach to other photoelectrodes with self-passivating native operational surface chemistry.</td>

We find that the vicinal surface of MgO(001) substrate results in a spin canting towards out-of-plane direction in the Ni and CoO films as a result of the interfacial coupling. The Ni spin canting angle increases monotonically with the vicinal angle in the studied range of 0-17 degrees and the CoO spin canting angle increases more rapidly towards saturation only at a few degrees of the vicinal angle. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy induced in the Ni layer by the Ni/CoO interfacial coupling is quantitatively determined and is shown to increase monotonically with the vicinal angle. Our result provides a new pathway for tailoring the spin orientation by modifying the substrate surface symmetry in combining with the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interfacial interaction in thin-film based spintronic devices.</td>

      <td>Structural symmetry-breaking plays a crucial role in determining the electronic band structures of two-dimensional materials. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to breaking the in-plane symmetry of graphene with electric fields on AB-stacked bilayers(1,2) or stacked van der Waals heterostructures(3,4). In contrast, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers are semiconductors with intrinsic in-plane asymmetry, leading to direct electronic bandgaps, distinctive optical properties and great potential in optoelectronics(5,6). Apart from their in-plane inversion asymmetry, an additional degree of freedom allowing spin manipulation can be induced by breaking the out-of-plane mirror symmetry with external electric fields(7,8) or, as theoretically proposed, with an asymmetric out-of-plane structural configuration(9). Here, we report a synthetic strategy to grow Janus monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides breaking the out-of-plane structural symmetry. In particular, based on a MoS2 monolayer, we fully replace the top-layer S with Se atoms. We confirm the Janus structure of MoSSe directly by means of scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and prove the existence of vertical dipoles by second harmonic generation and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements.</td>

      <td>ABINIT is a material- and nanostructure-oriented package that implements density-functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) to find, from first principles, numerous properties including total energy, electronic structure, vibrational and thermodynamic properties, different dielectric and non-linear optical properties, and related spectra. In the special issue to celebrate the 40th anniversary of CPC, published in 2009, a detailed account of ABINIT was included [Gonze et al. (2009)], and has been amply cited. The present article comes as a follow-up to this 2009 publication. It includes an analysis of the impact that ABINIT has had, through for example the bibliometric indicators of the 2009 publication. Links with several other computational materials science projects are described. This article also covers the new capabilities of Mimi - that - have-been-implemented during_the_last three years, complementing a recent update of the 2009 article published in 2016. Physical and technical developments inside the abinit application are covered, as well as developments provided with the ABINIT package, Such as the MULTIBINIT and A-TDEP projects, and related ABImirorganization developments such as ABIPY. The new developments are described with relevant references, input variables, tests, and tutorials. Program summary Program Title: ABINIT Program Files doi : http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/csvdrr4d68.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran2003, Python Journal reference of previous version: X .Gonze et al, Comput. Phys. Commun. 205 (2016) 106-131 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. The present 8.10.3 version is now the up-to-date stable version of abinit, and supercedes the 7.10.5 version. Reasons for the new version: New developments Summary of revisions: Many new capabilities of the main abinit application, related to density-functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory, GW, the Bethe-Salpeter equation, dynamical mean-field theory, etc. New applications in the package: multibinit (second-principles calculations) and tdep (temperature-dependent properties) Nature of problem: Computing accurately material and nanostructure properties: electronic structure, bond lengths, bond angles, primitive cell, cohesive energy, dielectric properties, vibrational properties, elastic properties, optical properties, magnetic properties, non-linear couplings, electronic and vibrational lifetimes, etc. For large-scale systems, second-principles calculations, building upon the first-principles results, are also possible. Solution method: Software application based on density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, pseudopotentials, with plane waves or wavelets as basis functions. Different real-time algorithms are implemented for second-principles calculations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

      <td>Recently, the electrical switching of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order has been intensively investigated because of its application potential in data storage technology. Herein, we report the current switching of the AFM Neel vector in epitaxial Pd/CoO films as a function of temperature. Using combined measurements of Hall resistance (HR) and x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) below and above the AFM Neel temperature, we unambiguously identified both magnetic and nonmagnetic contributions to the current-induced HR change. Through magnetic field-induced HR measurements, we quantitatively determined the percentage of current -induced CoO spin switching. Further, we showed that the thermal effect dominated the CoO magnetic switching more in samples with a thinner Pd layer and that samples with a thicker CoO layer required higher thermal activation for current-induced magnetic switching. These results provide a clear and comprehensive picture of current-induced AFM spin switching across the AFM Neel temperature.</td>
